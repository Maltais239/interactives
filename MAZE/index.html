                <h4>► WHAT</h4>
                <p>A maze reading assessment is a task that measures how well students understand text they read silently. The maze task differs from traditional comprehension in that it is based completely on the text. After the first sentence, every seventh word in the passage is replaced with the correct word and two distracters. Students choose the word from among the three choices that fits best with the rest of the passage.</p>

                <h4>► WHY</h4>
                <p>Capable readers understand the syntax of what they read and the meanings of the words as they are used in the text. Some students with reading difficulties can't comprehend what they read well enough to choose words based on semantic and syntactic accuracy. A maze reading assessment can identify these students and measure changes in their reading behaviors as the result of instruction or practice.</p>

                <h4>► HOW</h4>
                <p>Students read one passage that has been modified in a specific way. The first sentence of the passage is left intact to provide a meaningful start to the reading. For the rest of the passage, every seventh word is replaced with parentheses in which are found the correct word from the passage and two distracters arranged randomly. The student circles one word within the parentheses that makes sense with the rest of the passage.</p>
                <p>Neither of the distracters maintains the meaning of the passage. One is a near distracter that is the same part of speech or otherwise resembles the correct word. The other is a far distracter that is chosen randomly from a pool of words that are comparable to the words in the passage.</p>
                <p>The length of the passages varies from around 150 to 400 words; the passage is chosen depending on the grade placement or reading ability of the student.</p>

        <p>The student has three minutes to complete the task (reading the passage). The student's score is the number of correct words circled in three minutes. The grade levels and titles of the passages are shown below. For each grade, two equivalent passages (A and B) are provided; these may be used for pre- / post-testing and/or progress monitoring. Passages are provided starting on page 158.</p>

        <p>A Teaching Passage is also provided (on page 156) to use with students who may not understand the task initially; you may use that passage (and that passage only) to teach the task if necessary. Administration instructions to be used with the teaching passage are on page 155.</p>

        <h3>Scoring the Maze Reading Assessment</h3>
        <p>Compare the student's responses to the answer key (provided on pages 176-180) for the passage. Count any correct answer that is circled, underlined, or otherwise indicated. Put a check beside each correct response and a line through each incorrect response. Record the number of correct responses and number of errors on the corresponding lines at the bottom of the page.<br>For ninth and tenth grade students, use eighth grade scoring.<br>An example of a scored passage is provided on page 157.</p>

        <h4>► WHAT IT MEANS</h4>
        <p>The results of the maze assessment are reported as the number of correct replacements. This measure is consistent across assessment passages and grades, so a student's understanding of the text can be compared to prior or subsequent assessments and with other students in the same grade. A student with few correct responses may be experiencing reading difficulties, so the measure can be used for screening. Over time, the number of correct responses should increase as the student is able to read more text in the same period of time and understand it better.</p>

    <div class="page" id="page-154">
        <p>The scoring table on p.153 shows typical grade-level expectations for the number of correct replacements in a maze assessment. If the assessment is used for screening purposes, a reasonable guideline is that students whose score is significantly lower than expected (about half of the values shown in the table), will probably be having reading difficulties. If scores fall between those shown on the scoring table, teachers should take into account other sources of information in order to make instructional decisions.</p>
        
        <p>For progress monitoring purposes, the maze assessment may be used more than once if the students receive no feedback about their responses. Goal setting can be accomplished using the information in the table. Typical students will show a score increase from the beginning to the end of the school year.</p>

        <h4>► WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>A useful strategy to improve students' understanding of text is to pair reading with comprehension checks through peer questions, summarization, or retelling. Another good strategy is to create practice maze passages or have the students create the passages. Have the students collaborate to read the passages and choose the correct words. Ask the students to explain to one another why the correct answer fits best with the rest of the selection. If capable cross-age or adult readers are available, they can discuss why certain words don't fit because they are the wrong part of speech and why others don't match the meaning of the text.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Passage Administration (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Use this passage to teach the task to some younger students or older students with reading difficulties who may need a practice (teaching) activity before attempting the maze assessment. For these students, duplicate the teaching passage on page 156 and distribute it to the student/s. Be sure each student has a pencil. The directions are below.</p>

        <div class="script-text">
            <span class="script-label">Say:</span> For this activity, you will read a special kind of story. Some of the words in the story have been replaced with a group of three words. You are to decide which word in each group fits best in the story. You will circle the word you think is best.
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            We will begin with the practice story I gave you. Read the first sentence to yourself while I read it out loud.<br>
            <em>The bird landed on the ground.</em>
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            Now read the second sentence.<br>
            <em>It picked up a piece of (book, grass, tired) in its bill.</em><br>
            The word grass fits best with the rest of the story. Draw a circle around the word grass. (Check to be sure the students have circled the correct word.)
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            Let's read the next sentence.<br>
            <em>The bird flew (back, when, shirt) to its nest.</em><br>
            Which word fits best in the sentence? (Encourage a volunteer to choose the correct answer.) Yes, the word back is correct. Draw a circle around the word back.
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            For the last sentence, I want you to read it to yourself and circle the word that fits best in the sentence. Work quickly, but not so fast that you make mistakes. Now read the sentence and circle the word. (Allow time for the students to read the sentence and circle the word.)
        </div>
        <div class="script-text">
            The third word, the, is correct. If you circled another word, cross out your answer and circle the now.
        </div>

        <p>Check to be sure the students have circled the correct answer. It may be helpful to read the passage aloud with the correct words in place to ensure that the students understand the task.</p>

It was Sheri's favorite (step, stay, picture).</p>
            <p>"Do you remember when this picture (was, help, dish) taken, Dad?" she asked.</p>
            <p>"Of course (Them, I, Put) do. I took the picture." Sheri's (tree, drop, father) walked over to look at it (more, then, cold) closely. "Your grandparents certainly look happy (down, luck, in) that picture, don't they?"</p>
            <p>"Tell me (over, about, glove) that day again, Dad," asked Sheri. (She, Their, Boat) was too young to remember, but (that, she, ride) loved hearing about it.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said (it, sell, her) little brother, "tell us about the (hurt, pony, chase) picture." Rodney liked the story as (much, where, glass) as Sheri did.</p>
            <p>"Let me tell (yet, the, lamb) story," suggested Sheri's mother. "Your father (always, soon, trick) leaves out the good part."</p>
            <p>Mother (slept, leg, began) telling the story as she always (rest, did, skate). They drove to the farm where (Father, nail, pay) grew up. They had a picnic (since, coat, under) the tree behind the house. Grandfather (diving, brought, funny) a pony over and put Sheri (in, without, hear) the saddle. He and Grandmother posed (unless, with, push) Sheri and the pony. Father took (why, your, the) picture. Then Father asked everyone to (hold, climb, farm) still. He backed up to take (few, another, long) picture. As he walked backward, he (fell, have, mouth) into the pond, dropping the camera (early, old, just) before he did. And as always, (country, everyone, off) laughed, even Father.</p>

            <p>It looked like a parade. People lined the streets, traffic was (stopped, splash, storm), and utility wires had been raised (until, send, by) supporting them with tall poles. Police (waved, were, today) stationed at every intersection, and news (mountains, trucks, reached) were parked beside the street.

            <p>From far down (Main, crawled, spoon) Street came the sound of people (saved, clapping, another). It rolled up the street like (a, so, eat) wave, and soon everyone on the (basket, sidewalks, chase) could see the object of the (football, clip, applause). The applause wasn't for a parade, (but, his, city) for something much more exciting. The (wonder, Torrey, gave) House was being moved from its (kind, paper, original) site to a vacant lot in (red, the, draw) center of town.</p>
            <p>Ken held his (video, boat, around) camera as high as he could (over, after, take) his head while Mona talked into (why, an, for) audio recorder. They were capturing the (shady, came, big) move for their school's digital yearbook.</p>
            <p>"(Pick, River, Do) you really think you are getting (young, good, carry) pictures?" asked Mona. She had turned (off, at, chip) the recorder for a moment and (joined, looked, window) at Ken.</p>
            <p>"I practiced this for (berry, tease, weeks)," answered Ken. "I took videos from (where, girl, this) spot twice a week for a (river, month, please).

            <p>Mona rolled her (rope, eyes, high), turned on the recorder, and started (find, talking, horse). Ken was right, of course.

            <p>The snow couldn't have been better. Peter stepped into the front binding (up, of, tag) his snowboard and fastened the toe (pail, write, strap). Standing up, he pushed off with (his, sure, top) other foot and drifted into the (ship, line, plant) for the chairlift.</p>
            <p>"Hey, Peter, are (who, cat, you) all set for an enormous day?" (asked, stood, fence) Stacy. She glided up beside him (if, and, ten) pulled her goggles up onto her (noise, under, hat).</p>

            <p>"Let's drop into the sunny side (of, so, pig) the bowl and make a few (woods, black, turns) to warm up before we head (down, after, cover) to the terrain park," suggested Stacy.</p>
            <p>"(When, That, Start) sounds pretty good," agreed Peter. "While (to, move, we) were on the lift, I saw (Sarah, bell, middle) and her brothers heading that way. (Plant, Story, Maybe) we can catch up with them."</p>

        <div class="passage-content">
            <p>Sighing deeply, Jill sat on the bench in the park. A few of her school friends (been, were, scent) lounging on the grass. Spending time (in, off, shy) the park was something they did (floor, ruler, almost) every evening during the summer, and (green, tonight, course), they were waiting for a local (DJ, bat, fear) to put on some music.</p>
            <p>"This (bird, fact, town) is so boring," said Jill, and (next, most, pine) of the others agreed, adding that (there, else, case) was nothing to do other than (wish, cow, hang) out in the park.</p>
            <p>"I don't (know, plan, spill)," suggested Larry, "how about hiking to (ran, the, fold) top of the cliff? We all (call, harm, like) to do that, and what about (name, tonight, blaze)? We're going to get to dance (to, up, bud) music that we picked out."</p>
            <p>Rita (think, flower, nodded) her head and smiled. "The best (miss, hike, belt) is the one we take after (the, sit, cart) last day of school. What about (catch, dark, rafting) down the river? I think that's (open, even, while) better than hiking the cliff, and (it's, lines, age) a lot easier. Besides, our parents (step, wait, neat) for us and have a picnic (sadly, throat, afterward)."</p>
            <p>Almost everyone agreed with Rita except (every, wear, Gary), who argued for cross-country skiing across (less, the, bay) lake. "Skiing across Lake Washington is (something, party, hold) that most people have never done. (Toe, I, Cab) love calling my cousin in Texas (and, why, top) telling her how much fun it (bow, lap, is) every time we do it."</p>
            <p>By (if, now, tie), Jill was rethinking her comment. "Okay, (under, argue, maybe) this isn't as boring a place (as, so, cane) I suggested. After all, we're only (hot, a, side) few hours from New York City, (low, dart, and) all of us have taken the (bus, air, main) there with our parents. Remember when (those, ugly, we) went in for that ice-skating show? (Above, From, Seem) now on, when I do that (logged, room, boring) thing, maybe you should remind me (to, in, as) think before I start complaining."</p>

            <p>Tamara wondered about the people who lived at the top of the hill. She saw them every once in (a, is, red) while in town, and they seemed (youngest, interesting, listen) in an unusual way. The man (rode, lied, bear) his bike almost everywhere, and when (part, cook, he) brought the car to town, he (ready, always, office) had two dogs with him. The (block, woman, little) worked at the hospital, and every (once, now, keep) in a while Tamara would see (for, sky, her) running on Saturday morning.</p>
            <p>"George, what (red, do, glad) you know about the people who (live, carry, short) in the old Stevens place?" Tamara (asked, was, foot) tying the laces of her athletic (kinds, play, shoes) in preparation for an afternoon training (bird, run, want) with her friend.</p>
            <p>"Not much," answered (George, diver, shiny), who was leaning against a tree (sit, and, us) stretching. "He rides his bicycle everywhere, (over, pond, even) in the most dreadful weather, and (at, I, if) think he's some kind of scientist (save, fly, and) does research at the university. She (arm, dish, is) a big deal at the hospital, (maybe, today, rider) even the president or whatever they (join, call, warm) the person who is the boss."</p>
            <p>"(Let's, Fix, Joke) run up the hill and take (if, a, or) look at their place," suggested Tamara, (drink, adding, chair), "we have to do more hill (running, skate, spring) anyway." The hill was steeper than (trip, band, they) thought, and they were breathing too (hard, end, rest) to talk until they reached the (game, going, flat) part at the top. As they (snowed, slowed, without) down, a voice behind them said, "(That, Him, Oven) hill doesn't leave much breath for (cooked, talking, shop), does it?"</p>
            <p>A man on a (money, laugh, bicycle) pulled up beside them, breathing much (long, more, sign) easily than anyone should have after (a, if, to) climb like that. Before the two (at, spin, of) them could say a word, the (cage, man, cross) added, "Come on up to the (fruit, house, felt). You can get a drink of (leaf, tiny, water) and then run down with my (wife, sled, cook) You two are training for the (loud, state, draw) cross-country championships, right? I don't read (minds, wishes, shut), I just recognize you from the (deep, sports, point) page of the papers."</p>
            <p>With that, (he, on, pick) sped ahead of them, and the (stormy, jump, two) runners couldn't wait to meet his (wife, ranch, green) and find out more about the (classes, people, pretty) at the top of the hill.</p>

        <div class="passage-content">
            <p>The ferry slowly pulled into the dock on the island. After it stopped and was tied (recently, whisper, securely), a few cars and dozens of (quarters, between, passengers) left the ferry and headed to (except, wherever, yellow) they were going on the island. (As, By, Our) soon as they had cleared the (ferry, balloon, bright), a few cars and some foot (snowshoe, written, passengers) from the island got aboard the (kitchen, ferry, music).</p>
            <p>Among the passengers were a group (so, use, of) students who traveled every day from (why, the, cap) island to the mainland for school. (Not, Him, Far) enough people lived on the island (to, it, tall) justify building a school, so the (hunter, students, penny) crossed to the mainland by ferry. (They, Such, Duck) were met at the dock by (if, leg, a) school bus that took them the (than, help, rest) of the way.</p>
            <p>The Islanders, as (when, they, drop) were often called, were admired by (most, slow, nice) of the other students at the (teeth, being, school) because of their different style of (life, world, able). There were only a few roads (as, win, on) the island, and almost all the (colors, cars, dogs) were parked beside the ferry dock. (Why, Fit, The) cars were used mostly when people (smiled, went, roar) to the mainland or for emergencies. (Everyone, Princess, Telephone), young and old alike, either walked (at, or, owl) used mountain bikes to get around.</p>
            <p>(A, In, Fly) second unusual thing about living on (what, the, log) island was the water supply. There (nail, buy, was) no central source of water. Instead, (butter, people, empty) collected rainwater in big tanks. They (pumped, raked, night) it from the big tanks into (jumping, smaller, doctor) tanks where it was filtered and (hunted, began, purified) before being used. Needless to say, (remember, conserving, presents) water was important to everyone on (the, ago, let) island.</p>
            <p>The students who lived on (son, wear, the) island enjoyed their quiet life and (natural, dancing, turtle) surroundings. They sometimes missed the things (when, cold, that) students on the mainland took for (leafed, granted, family). There were no movies or malls (up, on, old) the island, and it was a (hammer, challenge, throwing) to be part of activities after (school, minute, whistle). Their lives were defined by ferry (schedules, neighbor, bicycle), so whenever they had a chance (if, to, way) do something with other students their (any, each, age), they really enjoyed it.</p>

They were usually the (first, great, empty) to arrive, and the rest of (way, took, the) players trickled in over the next (cloudy, fifteen, stopped) minutes. Christie was standing beside a (picnic, kitten, threw) table laying out enormous sheets of (soup, round, poster) paper. On the paper were the (station, results, closer) of games that had been played (up, am, day) to the current date.</p>
            <p>The most (hungry, numbered, interesting) part of this basketball league was (some, that, camp) every player was a member of (several, frightened, evening) teams. On the same Saturday, each (circus, slowly, player) would be part of at least (sky, two, get) teams. Although it sounds confusing, the (system, branch, already) worked well for a number of (sounds, reasons, terrible). Everybody got to play on at (least, bounced, rocky) one winning team. Players who weren't (if, bus, so) good were often on a team (down, with, ready) some of the best players, and (paints, nights, players) never became angry with members of (the, hot, face) other teams because they would eventually (if, put, be) on the same team as the (others, changes, picked).</p>
            <p>Henry helped Christie put the poster (brother, string, paper) up on the bulletin board near (are, the, wait) basketball court. If someone who didn't (ring, afraid, know) the system looked at the team (cutting, standings, planted), they would think that hundreds of (players, footprints, answers) were involved.</p>
            <p>"Your record keeping system (is, or, ate) very impressive," said a voice from (into, behind, card) them. Henry and Christie turned to (bat, fill, see) one of the high school basketball (breads, coaches, silver) behind them. She was a regular (visitor, haircut, widest) to the Saturday morning games, as (ride, face, was) the coach of the boys' team. (Us, In, Lay) addition to these coaches, some of (the, car, lion) parents often came to the games (try, and, sure) joined the players for breakfast afterward.</p>
            <p>(Day, Jar, All) of the players were a little (embarrassed, snowflake, mountain) to be playing in front of (mouths, adults, closes), but they also felt a sense (of, an, fun) pride. Over the years, many of (rat, the, like) players from the Saturday league were (points, chosen, shade) for the high school teams. Christie (bat, lake, and) Henry spent a few minutes talking (with, since, well) the coach, and then they excused (anybody, themselves, frightened) when other players started arriving. They (would, hurry, bumpy) warm up for a few minutes, (sea, give, and) then the first game of the (Saturday, ground, wonder) Morning Basketball League would begin.</p>

            <p>The bus climbed to the top of the hill and made a sharp left turn.

Before them (tear, bow, lay) the sea, glistening in the sunlight. (But, Sir, The) rocky coast here tumbled below them (with, for, tea) hundreds of feet. On the other (side, note, cause) was a sheer cliff rising for (a, if, to) thousand feet.</p>
            <p>The students were on (on, a, by) class trip to Europe, something that (speak, damp, none) of them could have imagined. They (act, milk, had) entered a contest to come up (down, with, stuff) a practical solution to a problem (up, lap, in) their area, and their submission had (been, speak, cellar) the national winner. The solution they (exercised, developed, passenger) and implemented was so simple that (they, sank, best) couldn't believe no one had done (am, it, jet) before.</p>
            <p>The students had requested that (the, why, beg) town council let them adopt a (holiday, borrow, network) of connected sidewalks. They would turn (the, map, lie) sidewalks into multiuse paths that led (or, to, mix) the busiest parts of town, including (was, shy, the) schools. With relatively little expense, the (carvings, sidewalks, certain) became attractive and safe places for (rewards, charged, walkers), skaters, and boarders.

            <p>(Under, Catch, Within) a matter of months, something remarkable (had, feed, swim) happened in the town. The number (her, of, all) cars had diminished considerably, and the (basket, number, shape) of walkers had increased more than (tonight, bring, anyone) had imagined. Downtown no longer had (traffic, minute, engine) congestion and parking problems, but it (dry, fire, was) busier than ever because more people (were, fish, box) walking. Even the school buses had (shopped, changed, spring) their routes and no longer came (but, zoo, all) the way to school. They stopped (unless, cover, instead) at a parking area several blocks (away, when, swim). Students walked the rest of the (bed, way, cow) to school on the multiuse path.</p>
            <p>(Just, Been, When) they heard they had won the (contest, light, silly), the students in the class had (if, add, a) unanimous vote and decided to do (a, to, nap) tour of some towns in Europe.

            <p>The wagon train had reached the foothills of the mountains. Rather than attempting to begin the (grinning, uphill, package) climb with fading daylight, the wagon (master, harness, elevator) decided to make camp for the (pitch, mail, night).</p>
            <p>With the rest of the families, (the, how, flat) Wilsons maneuvered their wagon into a (leader, fortune, circle), a formation that was the traditional (body, way, older) for travelers in the West to (suppose, protect, flower) themselves. In addition to providing a (line, floor, call) of defense against enemies from the (outside, anywhere, narrow), the circle of wagons created a (sailor, sense, purple) of community for the families, if (while, fold, only) for a night. It was almost (as, or, pot) if they were within the walls (be, of, tug) a small town, with a bonfire (letter, burning, searched) in the middle and people wandering (around, above, lesson) making small talk with one another.</p>
            <p>(Sugar, Scatter, Abby) finished her chores and asked her (brook, mother, scratch) if she could walk among the (hanging, other, crown) wagons. With her regular warning to (be, off, herd) careful and stay inside the circle (as, of, shy) wagons, Mother approved her request. Abby's (mirror, wiggle, father) smiled and winked at her, having (much, fine, post) more confidence in her judgment than (why, dot, her) mother did.</p>
            <p>As she wandered from (route, speed, wagon) to wagon exchanging greetings, Abby was (folding, joined, reason) by a few other young people (eager, giant, forget) to have something to do other (what, than, fail) chores. It wasn't long before a (group, rule, learn) of a dozen or so was (batted, sharp, sitting) by the central bonfire sharing their (shelves, thoughts, possible) about what would happen the following (comb, stir, day).</p>
            <p>"The mountains seem unbelievably high," suggested (Martin, judge, stretch), "and from here, there seems to (an, ice, be) no obvious way to cross them."</p>

            <p>"Has anyone considered the difficulty (do, owl, of) the walk that lies ahead of (in, us, ear)?" wondered Susan. "Have any of us (attempted, circled, glances) to scale mountains this high?"</p>
            <p>William (handled, plenty, laughed), and looking around at the other (teenagers, someone, sandwich), said confidently, "We've walked for a (delighted, thousand, adventure) miles in the last few months, (are, lip, so) I don't think the mountains will (be, up, seal) much of a challenge.

            <p>With that, (meadows, understand, everyone) laughed and rose to their feet. (It, Web, Net) was a pleasant moment before an (evening, traveling, ascent) that would undoubtedly be the hardest (drip, part, cave) of their journey.</p>

        <div class="passage-content">
            <p>The beach wasn't very crowded because the weather was horrible. A few people bundled up in (out, pat, bad) weather gear were fishing in the (surf, dress, avoid). They must have been very uncomfortable, (belonging, considering, bracelet) the crashing waves, the low temperature, (and, for, hunt) the blowing wind.</p>
            <p>Snuggling into her (apartment, raincoat, puppet), Joanne wondered what motivated people to (it, be, fan) so dedicated to something that seemed (important, awfully, whisper) unrewarding. She almost never saw anyone (catch, guess, early) a fish, they were out in (light, drum, every) kind of weather, and they were (almost, slowly, piece) always alone. Every time she came (he, win, to) this section of beach, day or (bird, night, slide), at least one person was fishing (from, bake, hall) the shore or the jetty of (edge, listen, rocks) that reached several hundred yards into (the, man, roof) ocean.</p>
            <p>About ten minutes later, Joanne (backed, reached, bravest) the jetty and scrambled up some (huge, slow, stop) rocks to the relatively flat part (on, if, rag) top. She stepped carefully from rock (to, be, sing) rock until she reached the far (mill, tired, end) of the jetty. Several of her (lower, friends, across) were already there, sitting with their (backs, wave, drink) to the driving rain. They greeted (when, her, soon) as warmly as possible, given the (bundle, conditions, haystack), and made room for her to (sit, pole, plan) among them.</p>
            <p>"Whoever had the brilliant (shadow, stove, idea) to have rehearsal for the school (note, play, wipe) here should be thrown out of (the, won, hug) drama club," she suggested. Pausing a (finger, moment, brushed) for effect, she added, "Oh, it (she, pea, was) my idea, so I guess I (earn, should, short) be banned from the club, meaning (I, of, as) can return home."</p>
            <p>As she pretended (up, to, in) get up and leave the gathering, (health, decide, Daniel) grumbled, "Not on your life." He (alarmed, throat, shifted) a bit to find a more (comfortable, astonished, growling) position and insisted, "Nobody gets to (squeeze, plain, leave) under any circumstances, especially the genius (saw, who, rob) suggested this location."</p>
            <p>"Actually, this is (a, or, say) pretty good location to rehearse, considering (wet, the, curl) play is about a shipwreck in (stormy, managed, growl) weather," argued Elizabeth. "The weather should (trade, cave, help) us get into our roles more (disappointed, thoroughly, cardboard)."</p>
            <p>The rain slowed down and then (bundled, stopped, hollow), although the wind continued to blow. (The, Why, Bed) six of them pulled their scripts (they, from, flow) under their coats and formed a (circle, visitor, lovely). As they did, Joanne began to (blossom, careless, understand) a little better what motivated the (space, people, steer) who were fishing.

            <p>The sound of so many riders clicking into bicycle pedals took Madeleine by (surprise, weather, clean). She had always ridden alone or (unless, with, wall) a few friends, and she never (called, realized, gone) that when hundreds of riders started (at, card, up), the sound would be both unusual (and, for, cop) satisfying.</p>
            <p>This was Madeleine's first century, (shy, top, the) name given to a hundred mile (hope, ride, hand). She was riding with her cousin, (hill, crow, Luke), to raise money for cancer research. (They, Hers, Cold) had raised more than a thousand (noise, dollars, stare) each in pledges from friends, family (bench, threw, members), and neighbors. Now they had to (look, bread, earn) the pledges by actually completing the (bark, ride, king), an accomplishment that neither of them (had, pump, save) ever attempted before.</p>
            <p>Doing the ride (use, was, dive) Luke's idea, and he had to (do, hurt, early) some serious convincing to get Madeleine (of, bat, to) agree to participate. He took the (lead, creek, rest) in training for the ride, but (them, it, we) wasn't long before Madeleine became enthusiastic (about, beside, aim) cycling. Her parents bought her a (new, kind, form) bicycle, which she was due for (either, anyway, lost), and she used her allowance to (leak, bill, get) some new cycling clothes and shoes. (Yet, The, Feel) shoes took a while to get (used, saw, apple) to because they had cleats on (but, roll, the) bottom that clipped into the pedals (of, up, air) her new bike. Her greatest fear (use, hay, was) forgetting to unclick when they came (up, to, our) a traffic signal, but so far, (us, rag, she) had avoided this embarrassment.</p>
            <p>The first (desk, cluster, begin) of riders started to pedal, and (each, chair, joke) successive group followed along. Madeleine and (Plant, Watch, Luke) were in the middle of the (all, pack, bird) and waited for a moment to (allow, sing, piece) the riders ahead of them to (jump, get, bath) a few yards away before starting (yet, fog, up). They were both surprised at the (sign, after, tingle) of exhilaration they experienced as they (fed, joined, lion) the other riders, and it wasn't (long, how, pony) before they were pedaling at the (cruising, buy, take) pace for which they had trained.</p>
            <p>(Less, House, As) the miles passed, Madeleine and Luke (wrote, made, cheer) dozens of new friends. Neither of (he, them, want) had ever thought about how much (bus, pie, time) they would have to chitchat with (the, or, fear) other riders, but when you have (a, it, ran) hundred miles to cover on a (stone, bicycle, decide), there's a lot of conversation going (on, long, open).</p>
            <p>By late afternoon, all the cyclists (hike, lion, were) feeling exhausted, yet none gave the (wider, slightest, visitor) thought to dropping out of the (gold, need, ride). As they reached the crest of (the, hard, mean) last hill, Madeleine and Luke caught (hat, sight, enjoy) of the finish area a few (grab, frown, downhill) miles away. Their families would be (hunt, gathered, reason) to greet them and they began (the, hole, dot) descent to the finish. The cousins (mailed, sister, had) no doubt that they would remember (but, this, pole) day for the rest of their (lives, ship, almost).</p>

Almost in unison, they said (or, rip, in) a questioning tone, "Starting college?"</p>
            <p>With (a, to, fog) tinge of pride in her voice, (arrow, Linda, wink) answered, "The community college has a (roomy, danger, special) program for high school students who (rule, have, path) earned good grades in advanced placement (courses, shore, upper).
