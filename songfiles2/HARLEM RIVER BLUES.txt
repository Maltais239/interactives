Chorus
E                                              A7
Lord, I'm goin' uptown to the Harlem River to drown
                     E                B7                   E
Dirty water's gonna cover me over and I'm not gonna make a sound

Verse 1
E                                                                A7
I'm on a roll, mama, I gotta go, I gotta get there while I still can
                   E                                            B7
Troubled days are behind me now and I know they're gonna let me in
            E                                                            A7
So when you see me walkin' up the QE2, just a-singin' and a-clappin' my hands
                                  E                      B7                   E
Tell my mama I love her, tell my father I tried, give my money to my baby to spend

Chorus
E                                              A7
Lord, I'm goin' uptown to the Harlem River to drown
                     E                B7                   E
Dirty water's gonna cover me over and I'm not gonna make a sound

Solo

Verse 2
E                                                A7
Good times come and they go, even a good man'll break
                       E                                             B7
He'll let his troubles bury him whole even though he knows what's at stake
       E                                                            A7
So I'm taking no chances, carrying over while I'm still good in His grace
                     E                           B7                       E
I'm no fool, mama, I know the difference between tempting and choosing my fate

Chorus
2x
E                                              A7
Lord, I'm goin' uptown to the Harlem River to drown
                     E                B7                   E
Dirty water's gonna cover me over and I'm not gonna make a sound
