Goodnight Rose, we're going to win

Put your troubles behind you, and go on to bed.
                                            G
Let go of the worry, there's so much nobody understands
                F
Don't live your life in such a hurry, life goes by us so, so fast.

And the sun will come up again, and I will be here,
           F
If you get scared just hold my hand
G           C              F
Tomorrow is yours, and who knows, maybe we'll win

The whole she-bang

C                                G
Good mornin' sunshine, a new day begins
        F
And the hustle and bustle of the traffic reach you kindly
                           C
I can tell because you are smiling
                                         G
C'mon give em' everything that the women demand
              F
Just one more ribbon rose, before the mantle place caves in.

And the sun will come up again, and I will be here

Rose, if you get scared, just hold my hand
    G           C              F
Get out of that dress, go on to bed

The bar is closed
F         C
Goodnight Rose
F                    C
Goodnight, goodnight Rose
F         C
Goodnight Rose
