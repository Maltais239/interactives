Verse 1

D         C      G
Been beat up and battered 'round,
D         C            G
been sent up, and I've been shot down
C                          G         Em
You're the best thing that I've ever found;
C      D       G
handle me with care

Reputations changeable,

But baby, you're adorable;
C              D
handle me with care

G      B7*      C     D
I'm so tired of being lonely,
G       B7*       C       D
I still have some love to give
G         B7*     C        D      G
Won't you show me that you really care

Chorus

     C                        G
Everybody's, got somebody, to lean on
         C                       D
Put your body, next to mine, and dream on

Verse 3

D                C             G
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled,
D         C          G
I've been robbed and ridiculed
C                       G     Em
In day care centers and night schools;
C      D       G
handle me with care

Verse 4

D             C         G
Been stuck in airports, terrorized,
D       C         G
sent to meetings, hypnotized
C               G          Em
Overexposed, commercialized;
C              D
handle me with care

     D      C         G
I've been uptight and made a mess,
    D             C    G
but I'll clean it up myself, I guess
