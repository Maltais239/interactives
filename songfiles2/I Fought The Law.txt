This song was originally written by Sonny Curtis who played with Buddy Holly and later
with the Crickets. I have not heard the Crickets recording but have always loved playing
the Bobby Fuller Four version. It has such a unique chord solo which starts off playing
C in three different positions. It's not too hard to play, once you get the timing for
all those triplets.
