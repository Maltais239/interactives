Submitted: M.N.K
Key: C


Refrain:
 C
I'm gonna shine up my boots
          G
I'm gonna go into town
 G
I'm gonna scrape up twenty dollars
                     C
I'm gonna throw it around
C
I'm gonna buy me a dance
              G
First lovely lady that I see
G
And when our dance is through
                          C
I'll say "Will you marry me?"

Refrain:

C
I'm gonna find me a game
    G
Of hold 'em if I can
G
And fold 'em all night long
                 C
Till I got me a hand

C
I'm gonna buy us a ranch
       C
With a palomino herd
G
And I won't mean no harm, babe
                   C
And I won't say a word
C
When Misery comes to call
      G
I'll give to him my life
G
I'll set with him awhile
                                 C
And share my horse, my home, my wife

Refrain:

C
I'm gonna shine up my boots
           G
I'm gonna go into town
G
I'm gonna scrape up twenty dollars
                               C
But I'll probly just drink it down
