Verse


Bb                 Eb
Some are waving it around
Bb                 F
Someone carried me home
Bb                    Eb
One was never noticed sleeping on the floor
F                  Bb
But I know we were there

Bb                    Eb
Some were playing in a round
Bb                   F
Some were dipping so low
Bb                               Eb
It never seemed to matter as the night slipped away
F                           Bb
Cause there was soul in the air


Chorus


Bb                 Eb
We were howlin at the moon
Bb                  F
We were shaking our hips
Bb                       Eb
Danced until we flat out fall into bed
F                   Bb
But I won’t let you go


Verse


Bb                 Eb
Let me in or let me down
Bb                 F
Let me lay here so slow
Bb                    Eb
Baby just keep holding got to move our feet
F                       Bb
Cause you know it ain’t end

Bb                 Eb
Step it in or step it out
Bb                 F
Cut it all in and run
Bb                    Eb
Kept on till it mattered baby I don’t even see
F                  Bb
But I know we were there


Chorus


Bb                 Eb
We were howling at the moon
Bb                 F
We were shaking our hip
Bb                    Eb
Danced until we flat out falling into bed
F                    Bb
Said I won’t let you go
