A                   E
You say that you're leaving
          F#m7           D
Well that comes as no surprise
A                       E
Still I kinda like this feelin
   F#m7         DAB
Of being left behind
A                   E
Yea this aint nothin new to me
          F#m7          D
Well it's just like goin home
A                       E
It's kinda like those sunsets
   F#m7
That leave you feelin
   DAB
So  stoned

F#m7A              E             B
Hey Hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
F#m7          A
 I fell thru this crack
      E             B
And I kinda lost my head
F#m7    A
I stand  transfixed
  E                B
Before this street light
F#m           A                  E B           E     EF#mD
 Watching the snow fall on this  cold December night    x 2 drums in

A                           E
I never thought this could happen
          F#m7             D
But somehow the feeling is gone
A                   E
You got sick of the patterns
   F#m7                DAB
And I got lost in this song

F#m7A              E             B
Hey Hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
F#m7          A
 I fell thru this crack
      E             B
And I kinda lost my head
F#m7    A
I stand transfixed
  E                B
Before this street light
F#m           A                  E B           E     F#mD

F#m7           A                E   B
And out in the middle of Lake Ontario (HOLD 4 bars)
    F#m7         A
The same snow is falling
       F#m7        A
On the deep silent water
    F#m7       A
The great dark wonder
F#m      E           B
Into the waves of my heart
F#m      E           B
Into the waves of my heart
of my heart
