       Am        G            C         F

I'm so sick from the drink I need home for a rest.


Verse

     Am       G            C          F
We arrived in December and London was cold
   C             G          F
We stayed in the bars along Charing Cross Road
   Am        G           C              F
We never saw nothin' but brass taps and oak
       C            G            F              G
Kept a shine on the bar with the sleeves of our coats


Chorus

       G                      C         G
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
          C          F
I've been gone for a week
          G
I've been drunk since I left
          G
And these so-called vacations
     C          G
Will soon be my death
       C             F
I'm so sick from the drink
       G          F
I need home for a rest

Take me home....

Verse

Am     G           C             F
Euston Station the train journey North
C             G      F
In the buffet car we lurched back and forth
     Am          G             C                 F
Past old crooked dykes through Yorkshire's green fields
        C          G            F                G
We were flung into dance as the train jigged and reeled


Chorus

       G                      C         G
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
          C          F
I've been gone for a week
          G
I've been drunk since I left
          G
And these so-called vacations
     C          G
Will soon be my death
       C             F
I'm so sick from the drink
       G          F
I need home for a rest

Take me home....

Verse

       Am           G           C                 F
By the light of the moon, she'd drift through the streets
  C             G      F
A rare old perfume, so seductive and sweet
      Am           G             C               F
She'd tease us and flirt, as the pubs all closed down
     C          G        F         G
Then walk us on home and deny us a round


Chorus

       G                      C         G
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
          C          F
I've been gone for a month
          G
I've been drunk since I left
          G
And these so-called vacations
     C          G
Will soon be my death
       C             F
I'm so sick from the drink
       G          F
I need home for a rest

Take me home....

Verse

    Am           G           C         F
The gas heater's empty, it's damp as a tomb
    C          G         F
The spirits we drank now ghosts in the room
    Am          G             C             F
I'm knackered again, come on sleep take me soon
    C                G              F               G
And don't lift up my head 'till the twelve bells at noon


Chorus

       G                      C         G
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
          C          F
I've been gone for a month
          G
I've been drunk since I left
          G
And these so-called vacations
     C          G
Will soon be my death
       C             F
I'm so sick from the drink
       G          F
I need home for a rest
