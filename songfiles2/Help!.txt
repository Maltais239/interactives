Help!
A                             C#m
  When I was younger, so much younger than today,
F#m                          D       G   A
    I never needed anybody's help in any way.
A                                C#m
 But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
F#m                                    D      G      A
 Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.
 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
E                                                  A(guitar run)
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.
A                                C#m
  And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
F#m                          D      G      A
   My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.
                         C#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
F#m                                       D    G     A
    I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
 E                                                 A
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.
