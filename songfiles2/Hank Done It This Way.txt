Lord it\'s the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
A                        D
Where do we take it from here?
A                         D
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
A                           D
It\'s been the same way for years
D               A     D
We need a change

A                       D
Somebody told me, when I came to Nashville
A                      D
Son you finally got it made

Old Hank made some hits, and we\'re all sure that you will
         A                           D
But I don\'t think Hank done it this way

Ten years on the road, makin\' one night stands
A                        D
Speedin\' my young life away
A                               D
Tell me one more time just so\'s I\'ll understand
          A                     D

Did ol\' Hank really do it this way

LEAD:
          

A                                 D
Lord I\'ve seen the world, with a five piece band
A                           D
Looking at the back side of me
A                            D
Singing my songs, and one of his now and then
         A                           D
But I don\'t think Hank done em this way
   A                             D                      A
I don\'t think Hank done it this way. Take it home.
