Key: D



D                                   C

Verse 1:
 G
Baby's good to me   you know she's happy as can be
              D
You know she said so
                  C              G
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Verse 2:
 G
Baby says she's mine   you know she tells me all the time
              D
You know she said so
                  C              G
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Middle:
 G      Bm          C               D7
I'm so glad   that she's my little girl
 G        Bm             Am             D7
She's so glad    she's telling all the world

I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Solo:






Then play magic "I Feel Fine" riff as band comes back in.
Then repeat from verse 2 to the end of verse 3, except instead

of the very last line of verse 3, substitute:
 D7                C              G
She's in love with me and I feel fine
 D7                C              G
She's in love with me and I feel fine

I Feel Fine    -   The Beatles

tabbed by Howard Wright
I'm pretty sure the song is in G - but if I'm wrong then adjust the
tab accordingly moving up or down a fret or two

INTRO:













This is obviously just the same riff moved down to different positions.
This is the main riff of the song.
In fact most of the song is just this riff played at the three different
positions (G,C,D)

The only different bit is  :
G            Bm          C               D7
I'm   so    glad  that  she's my little girl
G            Bm          C                D7
She's  so   glad  she's telling all the world
The solo is over the G/C/D riff.
Enjoy!
Howard
