Did I see you down in a young girl's town with your mother in so much pain?
      G      A            Bm         E               D
I was almost there at the top of the stairs with her screamin' in the rain
D                A     G        D                            A
Did she wake you up to tell you that it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E            D
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup with the promise of a man.

Did I see you walking with the boys though it was not hand in hand?
        G          A         Bm     E          D              A     D
And was some black face in a lonely place when you could understand?
A       D        A     G        D                            A

A      D       A              G     D                         A
Will I see you give more than I can take? Will I only harvest some?
       G        A            Bm       E        D
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp or fuse it in the sun?
A       D        A     G        D                            A
Did she wake you up to tell you that it was only a change of plan?

Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup with the promise of a man
