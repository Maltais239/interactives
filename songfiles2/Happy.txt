Happy
Rolling Stones
Key: B



B
Well I never kept a dollar past sunset,
it always burned a hole in my pants.
Never made a school mama happy,
never blew a second chance on love.

CHORUS
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy,
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
=============
B
Always took candy from strangers,
didn't wanna get me no trade.
Never want to be like papa,
working for the boss ev'ry night and day.
CHORUS
======
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy,
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
B
Never got a flash out of cocktails,
when I got some flesh off the bone.
Never got a lift out of Lear jets,
when I can fly way back home.
CHORUS
======
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy,
RIFF1
I need a love to keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
RIFF2
Baby, baby keep me happy.
