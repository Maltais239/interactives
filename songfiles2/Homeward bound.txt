Homeward bound
Simon & Garfunkel
Key: Bb


chords all wrong no guitar

Bb(D
I'm sittin in a railway station
      A(D                      Ab(DG
Got a ticket for my destination
Cm
On a tour of one night stands
   Ab
My suitcase and guitar in hand
    Eb
And every stop is neatly planned
      F
For a poet and a one man band
        Bb       Eb              Bb            Eb
CHORUS: Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound
|    G              F         C
|    Home, where my thoughts escaping
|    G              F       C
|    Home, where my music's playing
|    G              F         C
|    Home, where my love lies waiting
|    D        G
|    Silently for me
Bb(D
Every day's an endless stream
   A(D                Ab(D G
Of cigarettes and magazines
    Cm
And each town looks the same to me
    Ab
The movies and the factories
    Bb
And every stranger's face I see
  F
Reminds me that I long to be
CHORUS
Bb(D
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
     A(D                   Ab(DG
I'll play the game and pretend
    Cm
But all my words come back to me
   Ab
In shades of mediocrity
     Bb
Like emptyness in harmony
  F
I need someone to comfort me.
CHORUS ...
A(D      Ab(D      BbAbEbBb
Silently for me ...
