Hard Sun

Verse

D
When I walk beside her
  C
I am the better man
G
When I look to leave her
        D
I always stagger back again

D
Once I built an Ivory tower
     C
so I could worship from above
G
When I climbed down to be set free
    D
She took me in again


Chorus

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world


Verse

D
When she comes to greet me
       C
She is mercy at my feet
G
When I see her pin her charm
        D
She just throws it back at me

D
Once I dug an early grave
   C
To find a better land
G
She just smiled and laughed at me
         D
And took her bruise back again


Chorus

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world


Verse
D
When I go to cross that river
         C
She is comfort by my side
G
When I try to understand
D
She just opens up her hands


Chorus

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world


Verse

D
Once I stood to lose her
       C
When I saw what I had done
G
Bound down and threw away the hours
       D
Of her garden and her sun

D
So I tried to warn her
  C
I turned to see her weep
G
40 days and 40 nights
         D
And it's still coming down on me


Chorus

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world

D
There's a big
           Am
A big hard sun
                   G
Beatin' on the big people
                D
In the big hard world
