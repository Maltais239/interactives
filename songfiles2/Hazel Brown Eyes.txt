Key: Am

Am  F                     C  G                Am F
All I’ve have is a picture of you. I trace you with my little finger,
                     C    F
like I’m scratching it in the ground.
             Am  F                C    G               Am F
But that stopped working, I’m hurting and my mind is going down.
                       C      G
But that’s how it goes for me Baby when you’re not around.

Chorus 1
                               Am              F              C            G
But it’s gonna be alllllllllllllllll right my baby is back now
I’ve been waiting such a long time for those hazel brown eyes.
She keeps telling me it’s alright, your baby is back now.
Now I’m looking at them all night, those hazel brown eyes.

Am  F                      C  G                Am F
Last time when I said goodbye, you turned away without talking,
                        C   G
Left me standing there
     Am  F             C    G            Am F
But that was the last time, and this time she knows me by now.
                  C    G
She knows that I’ll be right here when she is back in town

Chorus 2
                               Am          F         C        G
Yes it’s gonna be alllllllllllll right my baby is back now
I’ve been waiting such a long time for those hazel brown eyes.
She keeps telling me it’s alright, your baby is back now.
Now I’m looking at them all night, those hazel brown eyes.

And I think she’s thinking of me, that’s what’s keeping me home at night
F  G                   F  C        Am          G
And I’m getting ready for her, ready for it all to be alright

Yes it’s gonna be alright
