Have I ever loved before?
Darren Maltais

Have I ever loved before?
he asked himself after they kissed
was that the same emotion at all
the same feeling
the same bliss

was i ever lost
no time or place
Did I feel joy before
before i saw your face

Was i ever held before
before your embrace
before you before us
was I
have I
did I
Hey hey
