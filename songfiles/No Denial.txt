No Denial
Melissa Majeau
Key: C

This is the first time
these thoughts have entered my mind
did you think the truth would give you a fine
it’s Just hard to think you’re no longer mine

Never a day I wished us apart
And I gave to you as I gave you my heart
Now to be alone and attempt a new start
Out My heart through my hands you depart

tell me dear
where you gonna disappear to this time
where you gonna dis

is this for better or for worse
to eb confused is a mighty curse
i need to be alone
i know itll hurt
like stain burned into this old plaid shirt

do you wanna go and see lyle
play and sing to us all his style
we have a date saturday night
we’ll go as friends with a smile
no denial man its been a long long while

tell me dear
where you gonna disappear to this time
where you gonna dis
