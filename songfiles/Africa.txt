A                    C#m7/G#     F#m7
  I hear the  drums  echoin'   tonight.
A/E            G/D              D/E         Dmaj7/F#
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation.
She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight.
Moonlight wings reflect the stars, that guide me toward salvation.
I stopped an old man along the way,
Hoping to find some old forgotten words, or ancient melodies.
A            C#m7/G#     F#m7                   G
  He turn to me as if to say, "Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you."


Em                   C              G         D
   It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you,
Em                        C              G               D
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
Em             C             G   D
   I bless the rains down in Africa,
Em                 C              G               Bm   D   Em     D/F#     G
   Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.


The wild dogs cry out in the night.
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company.
I know that I must do what's right,
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti.
I seem to cure what's deep inside,
Frightened of this thing that I've become.



Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.,
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
I bless the rains down in Africa, I bless the rains down in Africa,
I bless the rains down in Africa, I bless the rains down in Africa,
I bless the rains down in Africa, Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.
