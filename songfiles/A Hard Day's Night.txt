            E    A9    E                   D              E
It's been A Hard Day's Night and I've been working like a dog
                 A9    E                 D               E
It's been A Hard Day's Night I should be sleeping like a log
           A                          B
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will
        E    A9   E
make me feel al---right


You know I work all day to get you money to buy things
And It's worth it just to hear you say you're gonna give me ev'rything
             A                        B                      E  A9E
                                                                
So why I love to come home 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.


       G#m  C#m                      G#m
When I home ev'rything seems to be alright
         E    C#m                    F#m    B
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight,yeah

            E    A9    E                   D              E

So why on earth would I moan 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.
