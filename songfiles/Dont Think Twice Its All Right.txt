Verse 1:
         C               G              Am
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
F                        C    G
  If'n you don't know by now
       C               G              Am
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
D7                    G    G7
   It'll never do somehow
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
F                         D7
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
C          G            Am           F
You're the reason I'm a-trav'lin' on
    C           G               C
But don't think twice, it's all right

Verse 2:
       C                 G               Am
And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
    F             C      G
The light I never knowed
       C               G               Am
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
D7                            G      G7
  I'm on the dark side of the road
      C                                 C7
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   F                         D7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C        G            Am             F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C            G              C
Don't think twice, it's all right

Verse 3:
       C               G              Am
No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                            C    G
  Like you never done before
       C               G              Am
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
D7                          G    G7
   I can't hear you anymore
      C                        C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
  F                     D7
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
  C           G             Am            F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
C           G                  C
Don't think twice, it's all right

Verse 4:
   C   G            Am
So loooooong, honey babe
          F              C    G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    C         G          Am
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
D7                            G     G7
  So I'll just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                         D7
You could have done better but I don't mind
C              G        Am         F
You just kinda wasted my precious time
C           G               C
Don't think twice, it's all right
