The Littlest Hobo Theme Song - Maybe Tomorrow
This tab is based on the tab of 'bethanjane', I've just added all the lyrics and placed
Key: F
it under its original author's name.   Enjoy.
It's played open but I use a capo to suit my vocal range.

F (Intro)
  

          Dm                          C
There's a voice that keeps on calling me,
         Dm                             C
Down the road. That's where I'll always be
          F                         Dm
Oh, every stop I make, I make a new friend
               Bb               C                    F
Can't stay for long. Just turn around, and I'm gone again
        Dm           Bb             F  Am7  Dm
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
        Gm           Bb               F
Until tomorrow, I'll just keep movin' on

          Dm                        C
Down this road, that never seems to end
            Dm                            C
Where new adventure, lies just around the bend
           F                     Dm
So, if you want to join me for a while,
               Bb               C                  F
just grab your hat, come travel light. That's hobo style
        Dm           Bb             F  Am7 Dm
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
        Gm          Bb                F
Until tomorrow, The whole world is my home
           F                     Dm
So, if you want to join me for a while,
               Bb               C                  F
just grab your hat, come travel light. That's hobo style
        Dm           Bb             F  Am7  Dm
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
        Gm           Bb               F
Until tomorrow, I'll just keep movin' on

          Dm                         C
There's a world, that's waiting to unfold
            Dm                    C
A brand new tale, no one has ever told,
                F                             Dm
We've journey'd far but, you know it won't be long
             Bb                       C                  F
We're almost there and we've paid our fare with the hobo song
        Dm           Bb             F  Am7  Dm
Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down
        Gm           Bb               F
Until tomorrow, I'll just keep movin' on
           F                     Dm
So, if you want to join me for a while,
               Bb               C                  F
just grab your hat, come travel light. That's hobo style
        Dm           Bb               F  Am7 Dm
Maybe tomorrow, Ill find what I call home
        Gm          Bb               F
Until tomorrow, You know Im free to roam.
