Am
Moving like the fog on the Cumberland River
      Fmaj                 C/E
I was leaving on the Delta Queen
      Fmaj   C/E      G
And I wasn't ready to go
Fmaj      C/E      G
I'm never ready to go

Am
27 years of nothing but failures
       Fmaj                  C/E
and promises that I couldn't keep, Oh Lord
    Fmaj     C/E      G
and I wasn't ready to go
Fmaj      C/E      G
I'm never ready to go

       Am
Let it ride
            Fmaj  C/E      G
Let it ride easy  down the road
       Am
Let it ride
            Fmaj     C/E    G

       Am
Let it ride
               Fmaj   C/E     G         C/E
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers angels
Fmaj
Until it brings me home
Fmaj                              Am
Let it ride. Let it roll, Let it go

Loaded like a sailor tumbling off a ferryboat

I'm never ready to go

Am
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina
      Fmaj                 C/E
Where they were gonna bury me

I'm never ready to go

Fmaj
I wanna see you tonight
Fmaj
Dancing in the endless moonlight
C/E                     G
In a parking lot in the headlights of cars
Fmaj
Some place on the moon
Fmaj
Where they moved the drive-in theatre
C/E
Where I left the car that I can't find
    G
but I still got the keys to

       Am
Let it ride

Let it take away all of the darkness
       Am
Let it ride
