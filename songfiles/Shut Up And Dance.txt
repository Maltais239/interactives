Verse 1

           C     G           Am  G
We were victims of the night,
           C       G           Am  G
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
                 C          F       Am  G
Helpless to the bass and faded light
             C              G
Oh we were bound to get together,
 Am             G
Bound to get together.

     Am          G

We took the floor and she said

Just keep your eyes on me.

               C              G           Am  G
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
               C              G           Am  G
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream.
               C              G           Am  G
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
                C              G
I knew we were bound to be together,
 Am             G
Bound to be together.
