Verse

           G          Cadd9 G/B  D    D/C
Yeah, when I was only se-   ven- teen
        G               Cadd9 G/B  D   D/C
I could hear the angels whis- per- ing
     C               G                  Cadd9  G/B D
So I drove into the woods and wandered aimlessly about
       C               G                    D   D/C
Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
          G             Cadd9   G/B  D   D/C
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
     C           G                    Cadd9   G/B     D
Or a wolf to be exact, the sound sent shivers down my back
          C              G               D    D/C
But I was drawn into the pack and before long
       G                Cadd9  G/B        D    D/C
They allowed me to join in and sing their song
            C                  G                   Cadd9  G/B     D
So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah we would gladly get our fill
        C             G               D   D/C
Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
      G                  Cadd9   G/B        D     D/C
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
        C                  G                Cadd9          G/B    D
For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah and my thoughts, they surely were
           C            G            D   D/C
turned to instinct and obedience to God

Chorus

        C         G            Cadd9 G/B D
You can wear your fur like the river on fire
        C         G            Cadd9  G/B   D
But you better be sure if your makin' God a liar
      C            G              Cadd9 G/B D
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fu-el on fire
             C          G
So if you're gonna' get made
          Cadd9 G/B G/A G      D       D/C  D/B  D/A
Don't be afraid of what you've learned


Verse

       G                 Cadd9 G/B  D     D/C
On the day that I turned twen- ty-  three
      G              Cadd9   G/B     D    D/C
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
     C          G                   Cadd9 G/B  D
When suddenly a girl, with skin the color of a pearl
         C                  G              D   D/C
Wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
        G                 Cadd9  G/B       D  D/C
She was listenin' for the angels just like me
     C                 G                   Cadd9      G/B   D
So I stood and looked about, I brushed the leaves off of my snout
           C               G                    D     D/C
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
                G                 Cadd9 G/B    D     D/C
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
     C               G               Cadd9 G/B   D
So I took her by the arm, we settled down upon a farm
               C              G             D       D/C
And raised our children up as gently as you pleased

Verse

           C                 G                  Cadd9   G/B     D
And now my fur has turned to skin and I've been quickly ushered in
     C               G             D    D/C
To a world that I confess I do not know
            G                Cadd9    G/B         D    D/C
But I still dream of running careless through the snow
                C                  G                Cadd9   G/B     D
An' through the howlin' winds that blow, across the ancient distant flow
            C              G             D    D/C
It fill our bodies up like water till we know

G Cadd9G/BD D/CX2
        


Chorus

        C         G            Cadd9 G/B D

But you better be sure if your makin' God a liar
      C            G              Cadd9 G/B D
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fu-el on fire
             C          G
So if you're gonna' get made
          Cadd9 G/B G/A G      D       D/C  D/B  D/A
