F#m             G            D
So you saw that fire in the sky
F#m                    D
Well I think that¹s so cool
F#m             G            D
And I know that nothing will change you
G                A
you are nobody¹s fool
CHORUS
D    A           D         A
Cynthia, wont you take me to
G                 A
Pyramid Lake with you
         G               D
We could watch the space ships
             G            D
Maybe they¹d take us on a trip
G                      Em
Into that never ending sky
G         A                D
Into that wide and endless night.
