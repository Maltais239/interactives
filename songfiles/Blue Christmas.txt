E                              B
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
           B7             E
I'll be so blue thinking about you
    E7         E        A               F#
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
                        B7                      B
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
                  B7                  E
That's when those blue memories start calling
          E7        E                A            F#
You'll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
    B7                                 E
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
