Worries
Key: G

G
Worries, oh worries
All the rushes and hurries
        C
They'll pick you up
                           G
And carry you along in the current
              D
But you gotta swim
              C
Oh, you gotta swim
          G
You gotta swim
  

Tick, tick, tock, like some machine
But I'm built for comfort and
Not for speed
But you gotta run
Oh, you gotta run
You gotta run

A real small man
From a big big state
Tryin' to make you scared
To leave your place
Make you wanna hide
Oh you wanna hide
You wanna hide

When the villagers gather
with their torches in the night
All the things that burn
Ain't necessarily bright
But they'll burn
Oh, they'll burn
They'll burn

Worries, oh worries
All the rushes and hurries
They'll pick you up
And carry you along in the current
But you gotta swim
Oh, you gotta swim
You gotta swim

all the little things
that gather outside like a stormcloud
thunder so loud
ominous on the horizon
