Oh hello Mr. Soul I droped by to pick up a reason
        E
For the thought that I'd caught that my head is the event of the season
       A                                             E
Why in crowds just a trace of my face should seem so pleasin'
     D                           A                       E
I'll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown when a messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have esaily known me better
She said 'You're stange, but don't change' and I let her

D


In a while well the smile on my face turned to plaster
Stick around while the clown who was sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know - why don't you ask her

      D                                A
Is it strange I should change? I don't know
      D                                A
Is it strange I should change? I don't know
