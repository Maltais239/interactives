Behind Blue Eyes
The Who
Key: Em



Em                     G               D                  C          A
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man, to be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D            C                 A
No one knows what it's like to be hated, to be fated, to telling only lies


       C  D                   G           C          D        E
But my dreams, they aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C                 D                      A
I have hours, only lonely, My love is vengeance that's never free

Em                     G                  D               C         A
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do, and I blame you
Em                   G             D                 C                      A
No one bites back as hard on their anger, none of my pain and woe, can show through



D            Bm       A        E              Bm         G       D
When my fist clenches crack it open, before I use it and lose my cool
       Bm    A            E                 Bm        A          E
When I smile tell me some bad news before I laugh and act like a fool
D        Bm      A        E                Bm     A       D
And if I swallow anything evil, stick your finger down my throat
     Bm     A                E                Bm          A         E
If I shiver please give me a blanket, keep me warm let me wear your coat

Em                     G               D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
          C               A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
