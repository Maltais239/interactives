We'll be fighting in the streets, with our children at our feet,
        A                D               E
and the morals that they worship will be gone.
        A                  D         A                D
And the men who spurred us on sit in judgement of all wrong,
        A           D                 E      G D
they decide and the shotgun sings the song.

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
D      A           D       A
take a bow for the new revolution,
D         A           D          A
smile and grin at the change all around,
G                     E7
take up my guitar and play
G               E7
just like yesterday,
         G                   D
and I'll get on my knees and pray.

The change it had to come, we knew it all along,
we were liberated from the fold, that's all.
And the world looks just the same, and history ain't changed,
'cause the banners were all flown in the last war.

I'll move myself and my family aside,
E
if we happen to be left half alive,
     A
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky,
         B7                             B     A  E
though I know that the hypnotized never lie.

Nothing in the street looks any different to me.
And the slogans are replaced by the by,
and the parting on the left is now parting on the right,
and the beards have all grown longer over night.



Yeah,
A                    G   D
meet the new boss.
A                    G   D   A
Same as the old boss.
