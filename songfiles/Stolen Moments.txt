Oh my little one, sitting on my lap
     D/F#   Em                A                D
everytime I look at you, it's me thats looking back
         Em             D/F#           G              C
from the summer of your childhood, the autumn of your years
    G                                 D/F#      G        CG
the times we take for granted all too soon will disappear

       C                   G
Stolen Moments, are all we have
   D
to get us through this lifetime
G
all the good and bad
        C
someday you will be grown
     Gwalkup       C
with kids of your own
    Em                Am             D
and you will learn to treasure every day
       C        D                 G
Stolen moments, before they steal away

If I could, I'd stop the hands of time
          D/F#       Em
a hundred years from here and now,
A                  D
you would still be mine
        Em             D/F#        G                    C
but the world keeps on turnin, and soon youll turn from me
    G                             D/F#      G
and instead of holding you I will hold your memory
