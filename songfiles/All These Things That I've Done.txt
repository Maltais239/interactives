All These Things That I've Done
The Killers
Key: G

This is a great song, fantastic live. Drop-down tuning by 1 fret, that's what they do

Intro:

Synth plays really high G, so just play 15th fret on e-string if u want
G
When there's nowhere else to run
G                          C
Is there room for one more son
            G    F# root walkdown
One more son
       Em
If you can hold on
       C                   G
If you can hold on, hold on

G with riff d|-12-12-9-12------   then C chord stil with riff, then G
            a|-----------10-10-

G
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
G
You know, you know, no you don't, you don't
C                                 G
I wanna shine on in the hearts of men
G
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand

same chords all through verses, easy*

Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no no no no

G
Help me out
G
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
                                        C
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the backburner
                            G
You know you got to help me out, yeah

Verse:

And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be

Chorus

Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh don't you put me on the backburner
You know you got to help me out
                            Em
You're gonna bring yourself down
                                  C
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
                                  G
Yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down

When everyone's lost the battle is won
                                    G (riff again)
With all these things that I've done
                           Em
All these things that I've done (Time, truth and hearts)
       C
If you can hold on
       D
If you can hold on
       G to the end
Hold on
