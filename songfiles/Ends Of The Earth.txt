Key: E

Intro
E
Ooh, ooh x2

Verse
E
Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
E
I'm gonna see where it leads
E
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
E
I'm gonna stand on the peak

E
Out there's a land that time don't command
E
Wanna be the first to arrive
E
No time for ponderin' why I'm-a wanderin'
E
On while we're both still alive

Chorus
C#m                E                A      E  E
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me
C#m                      E             A       E  E
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
C#m                E                A      E  E
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me
C#m                 E          A       E    E
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

AAAAEEEE
       

Interlude
E
Ooh, ooh x4

Verse
E
Oh, there's an island where all things are silent

I'm gonna whistle a tune

Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured

I'm gonna count all the dunes

E
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl

Headin' out into the unknown

Wayfarin' strangers, and all kinds of dangers

Please don't say I'm going alone

Chorus
C#m                E                A      E  E
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me
C#m                      E             A       E  E
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
C#m                E                A      E  E
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me
C#m                 E          A       E    E
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

AAAA
   

Verse
E
I was a-ready to die for you, baby

Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay

What good is livin' a life you've been given

If all you do is stand in one place

E
I'm on a river that winds on forever

Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'

Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try

I guess I'm goin' alone

Outro
E
Ooh, ooh x5 ... (don't play on the last one)
