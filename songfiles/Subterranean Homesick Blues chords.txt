Bob Dylan

Capo V

E7E
 

E7                       E
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
E7                  E
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
E7                          E
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
E7                         E
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
A7
Look out kid, it's something you did
E7                         E
God knows when, but you're doing it again
           E7                      E
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
    B7
The man in the coonskin cap in the pig pen
      E7                       E
Wants eleven dollar bills, but you only got ten

E7                       E
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
E7                        E
Talking that the heat put plants in the bed but
E7                         E
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
E7                           E
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.
A7
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
             E7                  E
Walk on your tip toes, don't try No Doz
  E7                             E
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
       B7
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
    E7                          E
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

    E7                  E
Ah, get sick, get well, hang around the Ink Well
E7                           E
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
E7                    E
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
E7                     E
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
A7
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
     E7               E
But losers, cheaters, six-time users
E7                 E
Hanging 'round the theaters
B7
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
E7                        E
Don't follow leaders, and watch your parking meters

   E7                                E
Ah get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance
E7                        E
Get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success
E7                                 E
Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
E7                                 E
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
A7
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
       E7                   E
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
E7                  E
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
B7
Don't wanna be a bum, you better chew gum
    E7                         E
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handle
