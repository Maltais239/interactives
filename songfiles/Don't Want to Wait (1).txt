Don't Want to Wait
Darren Maltais
A D harp

They say, "Wait for the perfect time
Wait 'till the stars align
Wait until you can be mine
baby i just don't wanna wait

Someday...when does it come?
Soon...has come and gone
It all came and went and I said so long
So baby i just don't wanna wait

solo

Wait, 'till I'm good and ready
Wait, till my hands are steady
Wait, that's what the man said he's
Always telling me to wait

Tomorrow, it never knows
Lists I had, just seem to grow
Puttin' it off then there's nothing to show
Baby I don't wanna wait

solo

Wait until you're older
Wait 'till you're feeling bolder
You wait and you wait then it's all over
Baby I just don't wanna wait

They say, "Wait for the perfect time
Wait 'till the stars align
Wait until you can be mine
baby i just don't wanna wait
