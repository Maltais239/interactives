Am             G            C      D
If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn,
C              Em               Am
I could arm a town the size of Abilene.
                  C G    Em                D
Don't you push me baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low,
        C        Em   Am    Em      Am
And you know I'm only in it for the gold.
Am            G             C        D
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars,
   Am7      C       Em                 Am
And I could pay you back with one good hand.
              C     G            Em      D
You can look around about the wide world over,
           C     Em    Am     Em     Am
And you'll never find another honest man.
G         D           A
Last fair deal in the country, sweet Susie,
G         D           A
Last fair deal in the town,
G             D                A
Put your gold money where your love is, baby,
  C        G      Am   Em D        Am
Before you let my deal go down, go down.

Don't you push me baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low,
And I know a little something you won't ever know.
Don't you touch hard liqour, just a cup of cold coffee,
I'm gonna get up in the morning and go.

Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine;
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines.
Come to daddy on an inside straight,
Well I got no chance of losin' this time.
