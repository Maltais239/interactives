      F#m
I'm alright today

You gonna find a way to cross and you gonna get there

And I'm on fire today

Am I crazy or the wind is gonna blow me down?

         F#m
You seem tired today
         A                               D
Were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring?
       F#m
I feel fine today
         A                                D
I've had dreams of you in places I've not seen before
           F#m
You get so carried away
     A                             D
Like lovers new to bodies first to touch you here
             F#m
This ain't a getaway
          A                                 D
You built walls around your heart to try to lock it in

Chorus
          A
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry

I'm gonna leave it all out there

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up

I'm gonna leave it all out there

And upon the wind it's carried

Over the cities and the plains

C#       D
And everybody wants the same

Everybody wants the same thing

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
          D
I'm gonna leave it all out there
