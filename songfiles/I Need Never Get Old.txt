Verses:
G
Can we be there
                      D
Oh just think of the time

Thought of love so strange
                G
Said you never knew

While I try my best
              D
To cover our eyes
                                         G
It's a common way to blame and hide the truth

             C
I know that some will say
                G
It matters but little babe
                   D
Ah but come on and mean it to me
                 G
I need it so bad


I needed to try
           D
Needed to fall
               C
I needed your love I'm burning away
                      G
I need never get old

G
Taking our time
                         D
Ah just standing in the rain

Meaning what you said
                  G
Ah and mean it to me

All of these lies
              D
Oh and never again
                                      G
Come on and say it now say it's a game


             C
I know that some will say
                G
It matters but little babe
                   D
Ah but come on and mean it to me
                 G
I need it so bad
   D
Ah mean it to me
                 G
I need it so bad


I needed to try
           D
Needed to fall
               C
I needed your love I'm burning away
                      G
I need never get old


I said I needed to try
           D
Needed to fall
               C
I needed your love I'm burning away
                      G
I need never get old


I said I needed to try
          D
Needed to fall now baby
              C
I needed your love I'm burning away
                     G
I need never get old

I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old
