It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas chords
Meredith Willson 1951
Key: G

     G                   C        G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
     B7        C  E7
everywhere you go
       Am                   D
Take a look in the five-and-ten,
D7               Am
glistening once again,
     D               A7            Am   D
with candy canes and silver lanes aglow

       G                 C        G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
        B7    C    E7
toys in every store
        Am                 B7
But the prettiest sight to see,
       G               E7
is the holly that will be,
        Am  D7    G
on your own front door

          B7
A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
 E7      B7         Em
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
D7                            A7
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
       D7      A7         D
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
    D7              A7              Am               D   D7
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

       G                 C        G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
     B7        C  E7
everywhere you go
          Am                  D
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
D7                 Am
one in the park as well,
    D                A7               Am   D
the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

       G                 C        G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
         B7         C    E7
soon the bells will start
        Am                        B7
And the thing that will make them ring,
       G              E7
is the carol that you sing,
          Am D7   G
right within your heart
