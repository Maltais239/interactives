A
I hear it from all the treetops
I hear it and the world stops
  Dmaj7                         A
I come back, back if I've gone astray

A
All the wires buzzing your name
All the world calling the same
  Dmaj7                      A
I hear it. I hear it call to me

A
In the wind howling so loud
And the pulsing murmuring crowd
     Dmaj7                   A
They all say the same subtle thing

Bm         E            F#m  G
But in the dark days to come
Bm        E            F#m
Or in the light of the sun
Bm       E
When you come around
F#m     G
Pick me up off the ground
Bm               E
Let me know it's time
lick

A
In the deep daze of a dream
When things are not what they seem
   Dmaj7                       A
It wakes me and calls from far away

A
When the waves crash on the shore
When the dogs bark at your
   Dmaj7                           A
It wards them off like some voodoo charm

Bm         E            F#m  G
But in the dark days to come
Bm        E            F#m
Or in the light of the sun
Bm       E
When you come around
F#m     G
Pick me up off the ground
Bm              E
Let me know its time
lick

A
Hear it from all the treetops
Hear it and the world stops
  Dmaj7                       A
I come back, back if Ive gone astray
