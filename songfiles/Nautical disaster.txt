           Em             D            G
I had this dream where I relished the fray
        D                Em          D     CD
and the screaming filled my head all day.
          Em              D                  G
It was as though I'd been spit here, settled in,
         D           Em            D          C
into the pocket of a lighthouse on some rocky socket,
        D                     EmD
off the coast of France, dear.
         G                   D               Em    D
One afternoon, four thousand men died in the water here
    C            D                   Em       D         G
and five hundred more were thrashing madly as parasites might
   D            EmDCD
in your blood.
               Em              D                 G
Now I was in a lifeboat designed for ten and ten only,
   D                Em                 D
anything that systematic would get you hated.
     C                D          Em                D      G     D
It's not a deal nor a test nor a love of something fated-(uh).
              Em                      D          G
The selection was quick, the crew was picked (in order)
    D                 Em        D              C       D
and those left in the water got kicked off our pantleg
       Em              GCD
and we headed for home.
Em     G      C     D          Em                  D                      G
                      Then the dream ends when the phone rings, you doing alright
             D              Em
he said it's out there most days and nights,
    D      C              D
but only a fool would complain.
   Em  D             G               D
Anyway Susan, if you like, our conversation
      Em         D           C       D
is as faint as a sound in my memory,
         Em         D              G       DEmDCD
as those fingernails scratching on my hull.
Em    G    C    D  (repeat)
