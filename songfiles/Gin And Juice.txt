Verse 1

A                      D
 With so much drama in L-B-C
           A                 D
It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
      A                D
But I, I somehow, some way
              A                     D
Keep comin up funky ass shit nearly every single day
     A                               D
And, can I kick a little something, mmm, for the G's
     A                       D
and, make a few friends as I breeze through
                    A                          D
two in the mornin' and our party's still jumpin'
A                     D
 Cause my momma ain't ho-ome
      A                          D
I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
    A                      D
and they ain't leavin' til six in the mornin' so
A               D
 what you wanna do
        A                             D
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
   A                       D
So turn off the lights and close the doors
   A                    D
But, but what, we don't love them whores
       A                      D
And we gonna smoke a ounce to that
    A                        D
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

And I'll be


Chorus

A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all

Verse 2

A             D
 I got me some Seagram's gin
     A                            D
Everybody got their cup, but they ain't chipped in
               A                    D
You know, this type of shit happens all the time
    A                      D
You gotta get yours before I get mine
     A                                       D
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
             A                         D
He's got the cultivating music that be captivating me
     A                    D
But, a who, who hears the words that I speak
     A                      D
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
          A                             D
I started mackin' with this bitch named Sadie
              A                        D
You know, she used to be the homeboy's lady
                    A                     D
Don't you know it's eighty degrees when I tell that bitch please
                   A                D
Raise up off these N-U-Ts cause you gets none of these, at ease
A                              D
 as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze


Chorus

A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all

Verse 3

   A             D
So Later on that day
A             D
 My homey Dr. Dre
        A                       D
He came by with a gang of Tanqueray
A              D
 And a fat ass J,
        A                            D
of some bubonic chronic, you know it made me choke
   A                       D
It ain't no joke, I had to back up off it,
A                 D
Set my cup of gin down, Don't you know
A                               D
Tanqueray and chronic, well I'm fucked up now
    A                  D
But it ain't stoppin', I'm still poppin'
    A                             D
Dr. Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
   A                    D
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
             A                         D
Cause when I bust my nut, you know I'm ragin to pop a cop
    A                            D
But Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
        A                             D
I don't love you hoes, that's why I'm out the door

And I'll be


Chorus

A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
A                                D                        A
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
                  D
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all
