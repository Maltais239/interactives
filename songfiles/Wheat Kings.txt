Verse 1
G   C           G            C
 Sundown in the Paris of the prairies
G      C          G         C
 Wheat kings have all their treasures buried
G            C            G     C
 And all you hear are the rusty breezes
G        C          G           C
 Pushing around the weathervane Jesus

Verse 2
G       C                G        C
 In his Zippo lighter he sees the killer's face
G           C       G              C
 Maybe it's someone standing in the killers place
G                 C                    G       C
 Twenty years for nothing, well that's nothing new, besides
G         C             G             C
 No one's interested in something you didn't do

Chorus
D                G             C  G  C
 Wheat kings and pretty things,
D                        G             C  G  C
 Let's just see what the morning brings

Verse 3
G                   C                G              C
 There's a dream he dreams where the high school is dead and stark
G         C                  G               C
 It's a museum and we're all locked up in it after dark
G                    C         G                C
 Where the walls are lined all yellow, grey and sinister
G          C               G              C
 Hung with pictures of our parents' Prime Ministers

Chorus
D                G            C  G  C
 Wheat kings and pretty things
D                    G            C  G  C
 Wait and see what tomorrow brings

G              C            G C
 Late breaking story on the CBC
G         C               G              C
 A nation whispers, "We always knew that he'd go free"
G               C                G             C
 They add, "You can't be fond of living in the past
G             C                   G               C
 Cause if you are then there's no way that you're gonna last"

 Wheat Kings and pretty things

 Let's just see what tomorrow brings
D                C
 Wheat Kings and pretty things
                 C            D
Ah that's what tomorrow brings
