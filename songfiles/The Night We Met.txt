Verse
Em            D    G
 I am not the only traveler
Em             G        C
 Who has not repaid his debt
          Em              D        G
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
         Em         G        C
Take me back to the night we met
         Em    D      C
And then I can tell myself
         Em         G         C
What the hell I'm supposed to do
         Em    D      C
And then I can tell myself
        Em   G         C
Not to ride along with you

Chorus
      Em                         D           G
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
         Em         G        C
Take me back to the night we met
        Em                            D              G
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
             Em         G        C
Oh, take me back to the night we met
          Em       G       C
When the night was full of terror
          Em       G           C
And your eyes were filled with tears
          Em     G          C
When you had not touched me yet
             Em         G        C
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Chorus
      Em                         D           G
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
         Em         G        C
Take me back to the night we met
        Em                            D              G
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
         Em         G        C
Take me back to the night we met
