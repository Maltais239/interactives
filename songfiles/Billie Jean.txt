Key: F#

Intro: F# G# A G# (x2)

F#      G#          A            G#
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene,
F#            G#             A           G#      Bsus4
I said don?t mind, but what do you mean I am the one,
Bsus4                                     F# G#
Who will dance on the floor in the round.
A        G#        Bsus4
She said I am the one,
Bsus4                                     F# G# A G#
Who will dance on the floor in the round.


F#         G#            A                  G#
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene,
F#        G#                A
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed,
    G#       Bsus4
Of being the one,
Bsus4                                    F# G# A G#
Who will dance on the floor in the round.


D    F#m
People always told me, be careful of what you do,
D                                      F#m
And don’t go around breaking young girls hearts. (EeeHee)
D             F#m
And mother always told me, be careful of who you love,
D     Csus#
And be careful of what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth. (Hey)


F#     G#      A       G#           F#          G#
Billie Jean is not my lover, she’s just a girl,
A         G#        Bsus4     Bsus4F#   G#
Who claims that I am the one, but the kid Is not my son.
A        G#       Bsus4   Bsus4      F#  G# A G#
She says I am the one, but the kid Is not my son.




F#        G#           A          G#
For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side,
F#           G#                 A
But who can stand when she’s in demand,
     G#             Bsus4
Her schemes and plans,
Bsus4                               F# G#
cause we danced on the floor in the round.
A         G#         Bsus4
So take my strong advice,
Bsus4                              F# G#       A      G#
Just remember to always think twice. don't think twice,  (Do think twice)

F#          G#         A            G#
She told my baby that’s a threat, as she looked at me,
F#            G#                A    G#               Bsus4
Then showed a photo of a baby cries, eyes were like mine. (Oh No)
Bsus4                                    F# G# A G#
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby. (Eeheehee)

D   F#m
People always told me, be careful what you do,
D                                     F#m
And don’t go around breaking young girl’s hearts. (Don't break those hearts)
D         F#m
She came and stood right by me, then the smell of sweet perfume,
D   Csus#
It happened uch too soon, she called me to her room. (Hey)
