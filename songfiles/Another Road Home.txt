I used to go fishing with my dad
G         C        G
to the lakes of Waskesiu
G        C        G
And I know, sometimes I made him pretty mad
G        D        G
It’s funny what as kids we do

G        C        G
I used to go picking with my mom
G        C        G
The blueberries and the saskatoons
G        C        G
And I know, I drove her crazy all the time
G        D        G
She held my hand and told me what she knew.

And I’m traveling down another road.

I used to throw sticks in the middle with my brothers
G        C        G
Just what we did back on Greystone Drive.
G        C        G
I just didn’t grow that much ‘cause I was little I discovered
G        D        G
A big mouth helps you survive.

Now I’ll go fishing with my boys
G        C        G
And my daughter out at Ashlund Dam
G        C        G
They don’t even know, how every memory I recover
G        D        G
How every class made me what I am.
