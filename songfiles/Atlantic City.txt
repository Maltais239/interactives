          Em          G              C           G
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
         Em           G        C G
now they blew up his house too
            Em        G               C           G
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight
      Em            G                 CG
gonna see what them racket boys can do
            Em      G              C     G
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
        Em         G       C    G
and the D.A. can't get no relief
           Em     G              C G
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
        Em           G                           C          D
and the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

CHORUS
          Em        G         C       G
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact
          Em               G         C       G
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
         Em      G          C       G
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
    Em        G         C       G
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Verse 2 (same as verse 1)
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

CHORUS x2

Bridge

         C                         Em
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
C            D            Em
but with you forever I'll stay
C                                Em
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
(The Boss does as below. The Band holds the 5 and back into normal chorus)
C              G                         C               G
so put on your stockin's baby 'cause the night's getting cold
    C          G         C       G
And everything dies baby that's a fact
      C               G    D             Crit and hold
maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Verse 3 (same as first two verses
Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him

Chorus (same as other chorus)
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your hair up nice and fix your hair up pretty
and meet me tonight in Atlantic Cityx4
woo
