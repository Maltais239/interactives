Dmaj7                   D     G6                 G6/A
Stuck inside these four walls Sent inside forever
                Dmaj9G
Never seeing no one nice again
A    G    DGm6   G    DGm6  Dm7 Gm6AmD6AmD6Am
like you,  mama, you,  mama you

                          D                        Am
If I ever get out of here Thought of giving it all away
                        D
To a registered charity All i need is a pint of day
     Am
if I ever get out of here (if we ever get out of here)

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun
                              Fmaj7                                Em
And the first one said to the second on there I hope you're having fun

G           C    Em   C      Am
Band on the run, band on the run
        F              C               F             Fmaj7
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam were searchin ev'ryone
        C
For the band on the run, band on the run
Band on the run, band on the run

          C                 Fmaj7                             C
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh Seeing no one else had come
                          Fmaj7                                 Em
And a bell was ringing in village square For the rabbits on the run

         C                        Fmaj7                        C
Well the night was falling as the desert world Began to settle down
                                     Fmaj7                           Em
In the town they're searching for as ev'rywhere But we never will be found

G           C    Em   C      Am
Band on the run, band on the run
        F                C                  F              Fmaj7
And the county judge who held a grudge will search for evermore
        C
For the band on the run, band on the run
                                 EmGC
Band on the run, band on the run
