Am                G
As I walk along I wonder
                     F
What went wrong with our love
                   E          E
A love that was so strong


Am
And as I still walk on
  G                             F
I think of the things we done together
                      E         E
While our hearts were young

   I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Gbm
   Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
A
   Wishin' you were here by me
Gbm
   To end this misery


      A
And I wonder
              Gbm
I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
A
Why
              Gbm
A-wa-wa-wa-wa-why she ran away
      D                     E
And I wonder where she will stay
