Comes A Time
Neil Young
Key: G



    G           Bm                           D
(1)Comes a time, When you're driftin'
(2)You and I, We were captured

                              Am7          C
Comes a time, When you settle down
We took our souls, And we flew away

G
Comes a light
We were right

Bm                    D
Feelin's liftin'
We were giving

                        Am7                      C
Lift that baby right up off the ground
That's how we kept what we gave away

G    F          C                   G
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round

         F                 C              G
It's a wonder tall trees ain't laying down

                Dm7
There comes a time
