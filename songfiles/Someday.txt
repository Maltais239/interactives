A
In many ways
        Bm7
They'll miss the good old days
D6       A
Someday, someday

Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes

When we was young
Oh, man, did we have fun
Always, always

Promises
They break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

    A              E           F#m
Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth
D            A
I will do my best

You say you want to stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright

I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometime
        E
Oh, someday
                                A
Now I ain't wasting no more time

BAND OUT

And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So I  sometimes

Say faith my friend
You say the strangest things
I find sometimes

    A              E           F#m
Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth
D            A
I will try my best

You say you want to stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright

I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometime
        E
Oh, someday
                                A BUTTON
Now I ain't wasting no more time
