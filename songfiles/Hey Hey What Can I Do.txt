G          D              F               C
And in the bars, with the men who play guitars,
                                      G
singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
G         D              F        C
My little lover does the midnight shift,
                           G
she fool around all of the time
G               D              F              C
I guess there's just one thing left for me to do,
                                  G
gonna pack my bags and move on my way
                      D
Cause I got a worried mind,
        Em                 C
sharin' what I thought was mine
                                  G
Gonna leave her where the guitars play
