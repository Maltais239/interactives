C           Bb
Corn in the fields
C                           Eb   D      C
Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water

Verse 1
Am             G      Bb             F       C
I work for the union 'cause she's so good to me
Am                    F          Dm               E
And I'm bound to come out on top that's where I should be

Pre-chorus
       Am   Bb             C
I will hear ev'ry word the boss may say
    Am       Bb               C
For he's the one who hands me down my pay
  Am       Bb                  C
Looks like this time I'm gonna get to stay
Am      Bb            C           Am-G-Bb-F
I'm a union man, now, all the way

Chorus 2
The smell of the leaves
From the magnolia trees in the meadow
King Harvest has surely come

Verse 2
Dry summer, then comes fall
Which I depend on most of all
Hey, rainmaker, can't you hear my call?
Please let these crops grow tall

Pre-chorus 2
Long enough I've been up on Skid Row
And it's plain to see, I've nothin to show
I'm glad to pay those union dues
Just don't judge me by my shoes

Chorus 3
Scarecrow and a yellow moon
And pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town
King Harvest has surely come

Verse 3
Last year, this time, wasn't no joke
My whole barn went up in smoke
My horse Jethro, well he went mad
And I can't remember things bein' so bad

Pre-chorus 3
Then there comes a man with a paper and a pen
Tellin' us our hard times are about to end
And then, if they don't give us what we like
He said, "Men, that's when you gotta go on strike"

Chorus 4
Corn in the fields
Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water
King Harvest has surely come

Solo (an attempt :), the last few seconds may be a little off)
