Wind up hold tight baby gonna move

Strut down up-town rotten to the core

Believe me you'll see take me by the hand

We're rocked up and rolled out big time band

Of my time with you

Hard lips eyes closed staning on the shore
E      A  E    A        E            D
Chewed up spit out splattered on the floor
E A         E     A           E        D
I stare but don't care I'm never gonna leave
E   A  E     A         E     D
See my heart beat down on my sleave
