No Bright Light
Darren Maltais
Key: E

E                            B
The wishing well is dry as a bone
     C#m                       A
They tell me it dried up long ago
     E                           B
That well it never did quench my thirst
  C#m                              A
Besides I think somebody got there first

Always search and search some more
Now you're driftwood washed up on the shore
You were always rollin on the move
The water now has worn you smooth

chorus
           E                                  A
And you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
                                          E
When there's no bright light to guide you home
                           A
Tell me you don't feel all alone
                                          E
When there's no bright light to guide you home
B                            E
No bright light to guide you home

Just when you can't look no more
Stumble upon what you were lookin for
Seems loke you been there before
But now it's knocking at your door

And you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
When there's no bright light to guide you home
Tell me you don't feel all alone
When there's no bright light to guide you home
No bright light to guide you home

Write our story into a song
I don't think it'll take that long
It can be bittersweet I don't mind
All the best things take some time

And you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
When there's no bright light to guide you home
You're a light that I can see
and you can be the light for me
B                        E
You can be the light for me
                          A
You're a light that I can see
                             E
and you can be the light for me
B                        E
You can be the light for me
