December
Darren Maltais
I've been looking
I never seem to find what I
What I'm looking for
I've been swimming
Down through the gutter
That leads to the river that winds
To the sea

Cut a branch and it will grow back
Change your mind, you get the chance back
Get too far and you can go back
And we know thats not true

I've been wandering
I never seem to get to where
Where I'm wandering to
And I've been thinking
And I've been drinking
But I always seem to lose
My train of thought

Cut a branch and it will grow back
Change your mind, you get the chance back
Get too far and you can go back
And we know that's not true
