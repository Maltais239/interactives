Ripple
Grateful Dead
Key: G

Here's what I have.  There's another version floating around
with these chords and someone's tab, but I can't find that on my
machine right now.




G    C    G    D    C    G
                         
                                        C
If my words could glow with the glow of sunshine
                                       G
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
                                         C
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
          G       D    C               G
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

                                      C
It's a hand-me-down; the thoughts are broken
                              G
Perhaps they're better left unsung.
                           C
I don't know; don't really care
G            D     C           G
Let there be songs to fill the air.


Am              D
Ripple in still water
            G            C
Where there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow


               G                   C
Reach out your hand if your cup is empty
                                G
If your cup is full, may it be again
                           C
Let it be known there is a fountain
G            D    C              G
That was not made by the hand of men

                          C
There is a road no simple highway
                                 G
Between the dawn and the dark of night
                         C
And if you go no one may guide you
G            D   C           G
That path is for your steps alone


Am              D
Ripple in still water
            G            C
Where there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow


         G                 C
You must choose to lead or follow
                         G
But if you fall you fall alone
                               C
And if you stand then who's to guide you?
G             D    C                G
If I knew the way, I would take you home.


La-n-da-da-da-daa......
