 G                C
From Father to Son the blood runs thin
 G                C
Our faces frozen (still) against the wind
 G                C
The seam is split, the coal face cracked
 G                C
The lines are long and there's no going back
 G                    C
Through hands of steel and a heart of stone
 G                C             D
Our labour day has come and gone
         A
And you leave us holding on
    F
In Red Hill Town, as the lights go down

 G            D
I'm hanging on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to
 G            D
I'm holding on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to

 G               C
The glass is cut, the bottle runs dry
 G             C
Our love runs cold in the caverns of the night
 G               C
We're wounded by fear, injured in doubt
 G           C                      D
I can lose myself, you I can't live without
            A
Because you keep me holding on
   F
In Red Hill Town, as the lights go down

 G            D
I'm hanging on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to
 G            D
I'm holding on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to

 G                C
And we scorch the earth, set fire to the sky
 G       C
Stoop so low to reach so hihgh
  G       C
A link is lost, the chain undone
 G              C                    D
Now we wait all day for the night to come

       A
And it comes
And it comes
       F
Like a hunter (child)
 G            D
I'm hanging on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to
 G            D
I'm holding on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to
        G     D
We see love slowly stripped away
     F          C
Our love, has seen a better day
 G            D
I'm hanging on
                           F        C
You're all that's left to hold on to
 G            D
I'm holding on

You're all that's left to hold on to
