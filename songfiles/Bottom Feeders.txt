Bottom Feeders
Melissa Majeau
Key: C
          
          Am
Go on and strike that match if you’re willin’ and Able
                               G
Cane won’t mind the tea lights set out on the table
Am
Bet you to set your heart on fire til your love is unemployed
    C  G          Am
And desperate for hire

Chorus

          G           Am
Now we’re just bottom Feeders,
          G                     Am
Feedin’ together, we got nothin better
      C                         G
To do or say, a sling without a sling shot
E            Am
just wastin away just wasting away

         Am
Now it’s half past noon you’re still rolling in the gutter
                           G
Eyesore of the town making all the women shutter
Am
Foaming at your mouth your eyes are overglazed
                              C    G      Am
No one would reckon with you, back in the day

Chorus

          G           Am
Now we’re just bottom Feeders,
          G                     Am
Feedin’ together, we got nothin better
      C                         G
To do or say, a sling without a sling shot
E            Am
just wastin away just wasting away
