Jackie And Wilson
Hozier
Key: C#

Hozier plays this song on a
baritone tuned to B with a capo on 2. This means you can play it
on a standard guitar if you tune down
a full step and a half (C#-F#-B-E-G#-C#).

verse

E           F#m                          A            A G#m E
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
E                    F#m         G#m         A         A G#m E
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
E                F#m  G#m             A               A G#m
So deep in the swill with the most familiar of swine
      F#m          A      E
For reasons wretched and divine

E          F#m                    A               A G#m E
She blows out of nowhere roman candle of the wild
E           F#m      G#m         A           A G#m E
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
E            F#m        G#m             A         A G#m
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
     F#m              A    E
And lord she found me just in time

               C#m      G#m            A
Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
               D                          D    D#   E
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause god I never felt young

Chorus

E         F#m                  A                                A G#m E
She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
E         F#m          G#m          A                               A G#m
She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
C#m          B      G#m   A                                      A G#m E
We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
E          F#m            G#m           A
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Verse

E             F#m                         A                A G#m E
Lord it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
E           F#m  G#m     A                           A G#m E
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
E                F#m  G#m              A                 A G#m
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
F#m                 A        E
Sit back and watch the world go by

      C#m   G#m              A
Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
D                               D    D#m  E
We tried the world good god it wasn't for us

Chorus

E         F#m                  A                                A G#m E
She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
E         F#m          G#m          A                               A G#m
She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
C#m          B      G#m   A                                      A G#m E
We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
E          F#m            G#m           A
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Verse
E            F#m                      A               A G#m E
Cut clean from the dream that night let my mind reset
E               F#m   G#m                 A           A G#m E
Lookin' up from a cigarette and she's already left
E                     F#m   G#m                 A                          A G#m
I start diggin' up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
F#m                      A  E
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair

She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
