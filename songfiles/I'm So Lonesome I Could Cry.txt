Hear the lonesome whiporwill,
   E                      E7
He sounds too blue to fly.
    A                 E
The midnight train is  whining low,
       E        B7      E
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
                           E7
When time goes crawling by.
    A                E
The moon just went behind a cloud,
   E        B7       E
To hide its face and cry.
. . .
        E
Did you ever see a robin weep,
     E               E7
When leaves begin to die?
     A                   E
That means he's lost the will to live,
       E        B7      E
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
. . .
    E            E
The silence of a falling star,
       E             E7
Lights up the purple sky.
    A           E
And as I wonder where you are,
       E        B7      E
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
