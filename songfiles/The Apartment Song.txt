The Apartment Song
Tom Petty
Key: A



A
I used to live in a two-room apartment
                   E     A
Neighbors knockin' on my wall
Times were hard I don't wanna knock it
                E       A
I don't miss it much at all
CHORUS
D   A    E     A    D       A             E
 Oh yeah I'm alright I just feel a little lonely tonight
D      A  E            A  D       A             E        A
 I'm okay most of the time I just feel a little lonely tonight
I used to need your love so badly
Then I came to live with it
Lately I get a faraway feeling
And the whole thing starts again
(CHORUS and 2nd verse)
