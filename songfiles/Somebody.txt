C           G          F
If somebody woke up in my place
    Em          Bm7b5   C
And didnt know what to do
   G             F
If I was in your shoes
      Em      Bm7b5        C
Would I be as messed up as you?
            G             F
If somebody walked out in my place
Em              Bm7b5   C
Did better than I could do
         G              F
If I was up against the wall
      Em      Bm7b5        C
Would I be as desperate as you

C        G
Somebody remembered
F                Em        Bm7b5    C
All the things I dont but I really should
                    G
The things that you are
F    Em           Bm7b5
They cant be all good
C        G           F
Somebody blew up and took down the things
    Em          Bm7b5
The things that surround
C                 G    F
If I took as step back
          Em         Bm7b5Am
Would you let me get out?

Am         E7           F
I wouldnt wish that on anyone
G          Am
Anyone but you
Am         E7           F
I wouldnt wish that on anyone
G          Am
Anyone but you

C        G
Somebody believes
F            Em                 Bm7b5 C
And somebody conceives of these things
                  G  F
If I stand in the way
                     Em        Bm7b5
Would you bruise and batter my wings
C              G   F
Somebody takes part
    Em             Bm7b5
And sometimes its me
C                 G
If I stand on the sidelines
F                 Em           Bm7b5
Would you push me right in the ring

Am         E7           F
I wouldnt wish that on anyone
G          Am
Anyone but you
Am         E7           F
I wouldnt wish that on anyone
G          Am
Anyone but you
