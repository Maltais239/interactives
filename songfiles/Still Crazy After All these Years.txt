I met my  old lover on the street last night
      G                F#m           B7    Em7
she seemed so glad to see me I just smiled
     F                   G7
and we talked about the old times and
   C                    C#o7
we drank ourselves some beers
       G           D7        Em
Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on old familiar ways
and I ain't no fool for love songs that whisper in my ears
                              G9
Still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning crapped out yawnin'
 G#m        C7    F7   Em7       B  C
longing my life away I'll never worry
 B   C     G  G7    C         B
why should I  It's all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window and I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage one fine day
But I would not be convicted by jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years

Still crazy after all these years
