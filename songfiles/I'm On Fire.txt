E
Hey little girl, is your daddy home
                               A
Did he go and leave you all alone
                 C#m     A  B    E
I've got a bad desire, Oh I'm on fire


E
Tell me now baby is he good to you
                                        A
And can he do to you the things that I do
                  C#m  A   B   E
I can take you higher Oh, I'm on

                    A
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby edgy and dull

          C#m                          C#m
And cut a  six inch valley through the middle of my skull

E
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
                                                                A
And a freight train running through the middle of my head, and you
              C#m    A    B    E
You cool my desire, Oh, I'm on fire

SOLO OVER VERSE

(ooh ooh over C#m and E) with guitar licks


                    A
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby edgy and dull

          C#m                          C#m
And cut a  six inch valley through the middle of my skull

E
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
                                                                A
And a freight train running through the middle of my head, and you
              C#m    A    B    E
You cool my desire, Oh, I'm on fire

BAND OUT HOLD CHORD

E
Hey little girl, is your daddy home
                               A
Did he go and leave you all alone
                 C#m
I've got a bad desire,
  A  B    E
Oh I'm on fire
  A  B    E
Oh I'm on fire
  ARITB    E
Oh I'm on fire
