Key: A



   A                                                 D
Mama pyjama rolled outta bed, she ran to the police station
         E                                                      A
When the cop found out, he began to shout, he started the investigation
                     D                        A
And it's against the law, it was against the law
               E                        A
What what mama saw, it was against the law


Mama looked down and spit on the ground ever time her name gets mentioned
The cop said oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

                 D                A
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
          D              A            B          E
I'm on my way, takin' my time, but I don't know where
            D                    A
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
                G    D             E   A  DAE
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
                G    D             E   A  DAE
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard

(Instrumental break)

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
Now when the radical breach comes to get me released
Appears all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm on my way, takin' my time, but I don't know where

Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard
