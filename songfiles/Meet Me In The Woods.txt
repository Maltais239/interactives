Verse 1
  Em                           D       G
I took a little journey to the unknown,
      Em                      G             C
and I come back changed I can feel it in my bones.
  Em                          D          G
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see.
Em                     G       C
Now the darkness got a hold on me.
Em                     G       C
Now the darkness got a hold on me.

Em                   D        G
How long baby have I been away?
       Em                          G             C
Oh, it feels like ages though you say it's only days.
Em                           D           G
There ain't language for the things I've seen. (yeah)
        Em                         G          C
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams.
    Em                      G       C
The truth is stranger than all my dreams.
Em                      G       C
Woah the darkness got a hold on me.

I ain't never been away so long.
G                             C
Don't look back them days are gone.

Follow me into the endless night.

Meet me in the woods tonight.
