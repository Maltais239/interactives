VERSE 1: (play intro/verse)

if there's a goal that everyone remembers, it was back in ol' 72
we all sqeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger
and all I can remember is sitting beside you
you said you didn't give a fuck about hockey
and I never saw someone say that before
you held my hand and we walked home the long way
you were loosening my grip on Bobby Orr

CHORUS:
C         G                  F
Isn't it amazing anything's accomplished
when the little sensation gets in your way
not one ambition whisperin' over your shoulder
Isn't it amazing you can do anything

VERSE 2: (play intro/verse)

we hung out together every single moment
cause that's what we thought married people do
Complete with the grip of artificial chaos
and beleiving in the country of me and you
crisis of faith and crisis in the Kremlin
and yeah we'd heard all that before
it's wintertime the house is solitude with options
and loosening the grip on a fake cold war

CHORUS:
C         G                  F
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish
when don't let the nation get in your way
no ambition whisperin' over your shoulder
Isn't it amazing you can do anything

BRIDGE:
G
next to your comrades in the national fitness program
caught in some eternal flexed arm hang
droppin' to the mat in a fit of laughter
showed no patience, tolerance or restraint

VERSE 3: (play verse/chorus)

fireworks exploding in the distance
temporary towers soar
fireworks emulatin' heaven
til there are no stars anymore
fireworks aiming straight at heaven
temporary towers soar
til there are no stars shining up in heaven
til there are no stars anymore

CHORUS:
C         G                  F
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish
when the little sensation gets in your way
no ambition whisperin' over your shoulder
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish, eh
this one thing never goes away
I think this one thing is always suppost to stay
this one thing doesn't have to go away
