 Am                      G
Hello darkness my old friend,
                             Am
I've come to talk with you again.
            C         F      C
Because a vision softly creeping
                        F       C
Left it's seed while I was sleeping,
           F                            C
And the vision that was planted in my brain
             Am
Still remains
C           G         Am
Within the sound of silence.

                              G
In restless dreams I walked alone,
                        Am
Narrow streets of cobble stone.
                    F        C
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
                           F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,
         F                                        C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                    Am
That split the night
C                       G       Am
     And touched the sound of silence.

                          G
And in the naked light I saw
                            Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                    F       C
People talking without speaking,
                    F        C
People hearing without listening,
                 F                        C
People writing songs that voices never shared,
                Am
And no one dared
C                   G       Am
     Disturb the sound of silence.

                               G
"Fools!" said I, "you do not know,
                         Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
                       F          C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                      F          C
Take my arms that I might reach you."
         F                           C
But my words like silent raindrops fell
Am       C                G       Am
     And echoed in the wells of silence.

                            G
And the people bowed and prayed
                        Am
To the neon gods they made.
                          F      C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
                      F      C
In the words that it was forming,
                           F                                               C
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
               Am
And tenement halls."
        C              G          Am
And whispered in the sounds of silence.
