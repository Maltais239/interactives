Oh, I worked in the field all day
I didn't stop once, not even to complain
Yeah, I was next to you all day
No wonder I didn't complain

If you wanna take a break, let's take a break
If you wanna keep going, we'll keep going straight
If you wanna take a break, let's take a break
Take a break, take a break

Oh, I never worked so hard in my life
Never felt so tired, felt so right
Oh, I never worked so hard in my life
Never felt so tired, felt so alive

If you wanna take a break, let's take a break
If you wanna keep going, we'll keep going straight
If you wanna take a break, let's take a break
Take a break, take a break

Well, I could do this 'til kingdom come
Workin' all day next to my hon'
Yeah, I could do this 'til kingdom come
We only had to do it 'til the work was done
