I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For

Key: D



- ----- ------- ----- ---- --- ------- ---
        D
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
        G
Only to be with you
        D
Only to be with you

        D
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
        G
Only to be with you
        D
Only to be with you

           A              G             D
:/ But I still haven't found what I'm looking for /:


I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire this burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone

:/ But I still haven't found what I'm looking for /:

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
But yes I'm still running.
You broke the bonds, you loosened the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame, and my shame
You know     I believed it

:/ But I still haven't found what I'm looking for /:
