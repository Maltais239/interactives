Willin
Little Feat
Key: G



G
I've been worked by the rain
Driven by the snow
Drunk and dirty don't you know
But I'm still...willin
(And I was) Out on the road
Late at night
Seen my pretty Alice in every headlight
Alice...Dallas Alice
CHORUS

And I been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapa
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me
Weed, Whites and wine
And you show me a sign
I'll be willin' to be movin'

Kicked by the wind
Robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in but I'm still on my feet
And I'm still...in a whole lot of trouble
Smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun
Every time I go to Mexico
And I'm still....
REPEAT CHORUS
