I've been a wild rover for many a year

I spent all me money on whiskey and beer

But now I'm returning with gold in great store

And I never will play the wild rover no more

  G                                      C
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
    G           C            D7       G
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
    G                                     C
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
