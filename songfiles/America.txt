     Twice

C         Cmaj7         Am        C           F
Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
C             Cmaj7       Am
I've got some real-estate here in my bag
Em9                    A7             Em9         A7
So we bought a pack of cigaretts, and Mrs. Wagner pies
    D      C      G        C    Cmaj7AmF
And walked off to look for America

C       Cmaj7      Am          C            F
Kathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburgh
C        Cmaj7        Am
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
G
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
D    G        D       C     Cmaj7Am
I've come to look for America


Fmaj7                        Cmaj7
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
Fmaj7                                        Cmaj7
She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy
Fmaj7                                    Cmaj7 C           Am       C/G     F
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera

C         Cmaj7     Am              C         F
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
C             Cmaj7       Am
We smoked the last one an hour ago
Em9                A7           Em9              A7
So I looked at the scenery, and she read her magazine
        D    C    G       C    Cmaj7AmF
And the moon rose over an open field

C         Cmaj7   Am             C            F
Kathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
    C         Cmaj7      Am
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
G
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
        D   G       D        C    Cmaj7Am
They've all gone to look for America
