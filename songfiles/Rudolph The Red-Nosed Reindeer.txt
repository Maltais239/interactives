         C          Bm7        Am7         G
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
C         Bm7       Am7        G
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
Em           A
But do you recall
         A7                 D7
The most famous reindeer of all

Chorus
G
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                 D
Had a very shiny nose
D
And if you ever saw it
                      G
You would even say it glows
G
All of the other reindeer
                           D
Used to laugh and call him names
D
They never let poor Rudolph
                     G
Play in any reindeer games

Bridge
C              G
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
C             G
Santa came to say
D
Rudolph with your nose so bright
A7                 D7
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Outro
G
Then how the reindeer loved him
                         D
As they shouted out with glee
D
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                  G
You'll go down in history
