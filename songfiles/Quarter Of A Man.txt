Quarter Of A Man
David Lindley
Key: Am



          Am
There's a quarter of a man in the market
        F
With a quarter of a car so its easy to park it
        Am                                   F
He gets to the counter he saves what he can
        Am                                        F
But he only saves a quarter he's a quarter of a man

.......................


Now this quarter of a man he got fired

The next damn day he got hired hired

The only thing wrong with this plan

He only gets a quarter he's a quarter of man

CHORUS
Am Em  C       G      Am
Every day he's on the street
Am  Em     C         G           Am
Too few quarters to live or to eat
Am   Em    C         G          Am
He's so little the people all stare
        F
But he only pays a quarter fare
Am       F
Oh......

Now the quarter of a man's on vacation

But he still gets his ration

When he gets to the market he pays what he can

But he only pays a quarter he's a quarter of a man

CHORUS



All the regular comments about the integrity /accuracy of this, my own
interpretation of 1/4 OF A MAN
