Just Another Number
Darren Maltais
Key: A

A
Times were strange, upside down
no one could see for lookin around
D          E
we departed
                            A
feom all the good things we started

A   D  E
and we wait
                 A
for just another number
A   D     E
but we're late
for just another number

did you ever think you'd hear that sound
of echoing voices batting around
I'm choking
from all the fires smoking

and we wait
for just another number
but we're late
for just another number

Blood in the water
we're swimming around
all we need is solid ground
I'm tired
of sittin' like a bird on a wire

Can you relate
to just another number?
is that your fate?
just anothe number

world'll keep turning
through the spin
we'll look back and laugh
at the shape we were in
time
only thing that'll make it fine

and we wait
for just another number
but we're late
for just another number
Don't wanna be
just another number
