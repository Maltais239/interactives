Pause
Darren Maltais
Key: Bb
Bb to F intro
F
I’d like to pause this moment in time
                                                       C
I’d like to always feel your lips on mine and we’ll pretend
                           F
That the good things never end

I’d like to burn this picture of you
Into my mind’s eye so I never forget
what you look like right now right now right now

Bb
Why does it go?
                              F
Like summer giving way to the snow
            Bb
Why does it change?
                              F
The familiar gives way to the strange
          C                  F
And rearranges everything we know

I’d like your voice to ring in my ears
And that those words that you said would never disappear
From my thoughts my thoughts my thoughts my thoughts

bridge Bb to F and to the C

I like that look right there in your eye
And hope the things that we feel never get left behind
Why does a heart with a spark go dim and dark sometimes


Why does it go?
Like summer giving way to the snow
Why does it change?
The familiar gives way to the strange
And rearrange
Why does it go?
Like summer giving way to the snow
Why does it change?
The familiar gives way to the strange
And rearrange everything we know
F
