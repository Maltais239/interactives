I fall out of bed at the break of day
Wondering where the night went
I hear a voice say, Yeah youll be okay
This woman, shes heaven sent

Hot coffee on the stove, I lose my train of thought
So I turn up the radio
I can take their bad news, thats all theyve got
What else is there? I dont know

C              G         D
Love is such a hard hard word
         C                G          D
When she tells you Youve got it all wrong

Em
 Shell make you come back
      C             G
Shell make you come back
      D                       C      Em
Shell make you come back down to the ground
Em
 Shell make you come back
      C             G
Shell make you come back
      D                       C      Em
Shell make you come back down to the ground

He walks up to the bus stop and waits in the cold
Like old man winter, hes busy freezing
Theres nothing hed like more than a warm hand to hold
But thats just loneliness talking
The streetlights are on
Smoke rises from the rooftops
Through the haze I can see the moon
Her pale soft face lying there on a pillow
Dreaming like the month of June

C              G           D
Love is such a sweet sweet word
     C              G         D
When both feet dont touch the ground

(Chorus)

C              G         D
Love is such a hard hard word
         C          G          D
When you know youve got it all wrong
Love is such a sweet sweet word
When both feet dont touch the ground
Dont touch the ground
Dont touch the ground
