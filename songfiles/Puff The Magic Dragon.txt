C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    F                C      Am        D7               G7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah-lee,
C             Em    F                 C
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
    F                       C       Am      D7    G7    C
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff.
G7
Oh!

C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    F                C      Am        D7               G7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah-lee,
C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    F                C      Am        D7          G7   C
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah-lee,

   C                 Em          F                  C
To-gether they would travel on a boat with billowed sail,
F             C                   Am        D7     G7
Jackie kept a look-out perched on Puff's gi-gantic tail,
C               Em            F                  C
Noble kings and princes would bow when-e'er they came,
    F                  C           Am        D7          G7      C
And Pirate ships would low'r their flag when Puff roared out his name.
G7
Oh!

  C               Em        F             C
A dragon lives fo-rever but not so little boys,
F                 C                Am      D7    G7
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys,
C                 Em               F             C
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
    F                C          Am         D7   G7   C
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fear-less roar.
G7
Oh!

Repeat Chorus

    C                Em            F                C
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
F              C              Am       D7     G7
Puff no longer went to play a-long the cherry lane,
     C                Em      F                 C
With-out his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
   F                C             Am        D7  G7  C
So Puff that mighty dragon, sadly slipped in-to his cave.
G7
Oh!

C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    F                C      Am        D7               G7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah-lee,
C               Em     F            C
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    F                C      Am        D7          G7     C F CG7C
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Ho-nah-Lee.
