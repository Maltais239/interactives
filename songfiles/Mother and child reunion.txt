No I would not give you false hope
C       C       D       D       GGGG
on this strange and mournful day
C       C       D       D       GGEmEm
but the mother and child reunion
Am      Am      G       GDDDD
is only a moment away....
D       D       Em      Em   EmEm
o.o.oh little darling of mine
D       D       D       D
I can't for the life of me
Em      Em      Em   Em
remember a sadder day
D       D       D       D
I know they say let it be
Em      Em      Em      Em
but it just don't work out that way
C       C       C       C
And the course of a lifetime runs
D       D       D  D
over and over again
C       C       D       D       G       GGG
But I would not give you false hope, No!
C       C       D       D       GGGG
on this strange and mournful day
C       C       D       D       GGEmEm
but the mother and child reunion
Am      Am      G    GDDDD
is only a motion away
D       D       Em      Em    EmEm
o.o.oh little darling of mine
D       D       D       D
I just can't believe its so
Em      Em      Em      Em
and though it seems strange to say
D       D       D       D
I've never been laid so low
Em      Em      Em      Em
in such a mysterious way
C       C       C       C
And the course of a lifetime runs
D       D       D  D
over and over again
C       C       D       D       G       GGG
But I would not give you false hope, No!
C       C       D       D       GGGG
on this strange and mournful day
C       C       D       D       GGEmEm
but the mother and child reunion
Am      Am      G       G       D       D   DDG
is only a motion away..away..away  away
