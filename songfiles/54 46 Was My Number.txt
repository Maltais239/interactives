verse 1
         G7                                   C7
Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
    G7                  C7
And give it to a police man?
           G7          C7
I wouldn't do that, oh no (ooh, ooh)
           G7            C7
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)

         G7               C7
And if I do that, I would say "Sir
     G7                       C7
Come on and put the charge on me"
           G7            C7
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)
           G7            C7
I wouldn't do that (ooh, ooh)

          G7              C7
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
          G7                           C7
So I was innocent of what they done to me
           G7            C7
They were wrong (give it to me one more time)
           G7    C7
They were wrong (ooh yeah)
