I  met my love by  the gas works wall, Dreamed a dream by the old canal

I kissed my girl by the factory wall... Dirty old town, Dirty old Town...
            C
Clouds are drifting across the moon
          F
Cats are prowling on their beats
Springs a girl on the streets at night
 G               Am
dirty old town, dirty old town

        C
Heard a siren from the dock
      F
saw a train cut the night on fire
smelled the breeze on the smokey wind
G               Am
Dirty old town, dirty old town

         C
I'm going to make me a big sharp axe
         F
shining steel tempered in the fire
I'll cut you down like an old dead tree
G               Am
dirty old town, dirty old town

       C
Met my love, by the gas yard wall
          F
Dreamed a dream, by the old canal
Kissed my girl, by the factory wall
G               Am
Dirty old town, dirty old town
