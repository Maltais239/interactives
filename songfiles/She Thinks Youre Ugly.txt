She Thinks Youre Ugly
Three Dead Trolls In A Baggie
Key: G

Verse One
G                                   D
If she says she thinks you're cool, then she thinks you're hot
Em                                 C
If she says she thinks you're hot, then she likes you a lot
G                                  D
If she says "hey, lets go dancing. We could have a good time"
Em                               C
Then it means maybe dinner and a bottle of wine.
D                            C
But if she says lets just be friends,
D                         C
You know it only means one thing

Chorus One
G                   D                   Em                 C
She thinks you're ugly, and she wouldn't want to go out with you.
G                   D                   Em                  C
She thinks you're ugly, but because of all the neat things you do, she's
                       D
hoping you can still be pals.

Verse Two
G                                        D
If she says she thinks you're sensitive, she must like your heart
Em                                  C
If she says she likes your glasses, then she thinks you're smart
G                                   D
And she says that your shoulder is a great place to cry
Em                                  C
And that she's really really lucky because you're such a nice guy
D                             C
But if you go to kiss her good night and she says
D                     C
"Would a handshake be alright?"

Chorus Two
G                   D                   Em                 C
She thinks you're ugly, and she wouldn't want to go out with you
G                   D                   Em                 C
She thinks you're ugly, but because of all the neat things you do, she's
                       D
hoping you can still be buds.

Verse Three
G                          D
So remember the next time you're out with a girl
Em                         C
There's so many different words in the world.
G                            D
Listen to what she's saying, think of what she means
Em                                  C
There could be something happening, something unseen
D                                   C
And if she wants to sleep with you and the very next day
D                        C
She only wants to be your friend.

Chorus Three
G                 D            Em                     C
She thinks you're ugly, or you weren't to good in bed last night
G                 D            Em                     C
But mostly, you're ugly, plus she was drunk and kind of horny
G                 D           Em                      C
She thinks you're ugly, and she wouldn't want to go out with you
G                 D            Em                     C
She thinks you're ugly, but because of all the neat things you do, she's
                        D
hoping you can still be friends
C        G
Uggggggg-ly
