<"New Mother Nature">
bass walk up, new bass line
Verse 1:
  electric piano plays F#
D
Bass C# F#
Jocko says yes and I believe him
When we talk about the things I say
She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
When they're standing in each other's way
You're driven back in time to places you been to
You wonder what you're gonna find
You know you been wrong but it won't be long
Before you leave 'em all far behind

Chorus:
B7                          F#7

'Cause it's the new Mother Nature takin' over
B7                           F#7

It's the new splendid lady come to call
B7                         F#7

It's the new Mother Nature takin' over
E         F#

She's gettin' us all  (2x)

Verse 2:
Jocko said no when I came back last time
It's lookin' like I lost a friend
No use callin' 'cause the sky is fallin'
It's gettin' pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We're gonna get it on right tonight

                               
B7                          F#7
'Cause it's the new Mother Nature takin' over
B7                           F#7

It's the new splendid lady come to call
B7                         F#7

It's the new Mother Nature takin' over
E         F#

She's gettin' us all  (2x)
