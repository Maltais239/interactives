Spanish Castle Magic
Jimi Hendrix

It's not very far away
It takes about a half a day
To get there
If we travel by my
Dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same, ha ha
You know the name and the winds just, right

Hang on my darling
Hang on to me if you wanna go
Your love puts its all right on the shelf
When you gimme that Spanish castle magic
Some Spanish castle magic

When the clouds are really low
And they overflow like cotton candy
And battlegrounds
Red and brown

But it's all in your mind
Don't waste your time
On little things like
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hang on my darling
Hang on to me if you wanna go
Your love puts it's all right on the shelf
When you gimme some Spanish castle magic
Oh, Spanish castle magic, ohh

When the clouds are really low
And they overflow like cotton candy
And battlegrounds
Red and brown

But it's all in your mind
So don't waste your time
On little things like
Yeha, yeah

Hang on my darling
Hang on to me if you wanna go
Your love puts it's all right on the shelf
Come on baby, show your Spanish castle magic
Oh, Spanish castle magic, come on baby, come on
Spanish castle magic, yeah
Spanish castle magic

Hang on, come on, come on baby
Which one you want, baby
I say, your love put me right on the shelf
When you gimme some Spanish castle magic
Give me that Spanish castle magic
I need Spanish castle magic, baby

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
oh yeah
Shoot me
