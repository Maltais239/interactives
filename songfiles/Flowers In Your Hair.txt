Flowers In Your Hair
Verse
Key: G

G
When we were younger
G
We thought everyone was on our side
G
Then we grew a little
                    Cadd9
And romanticized the time I saw
                     G
Flowers in your hair
               D
See it takes a boy to live
      Cadd9                            G
Takes a man to pretend he was there

G
So then we grew a little
    G
And knew a lot
G
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
             Cadd9
And all the things we said
                         G
We were self assured
             D
Cause it's a long road to wisdom
           Cadd9                         G
But it's a short one to being ignored


Chorus

         Em     D
Be in my eyes
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
Be in my eyes, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart


Verse

G
So now I think that I could love you back
G
And I hope its not too late
G
'Cause youre so attractive
       Cadd9
And the way you move
                     G
I won't close my eyes
         D
Cause it takes a man to live
           Cadd9                             G
it takes a woman to make him compromise


Chorus

         Em     D
Be in my eyes
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
Be in my eyes, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart
