I ve seen the bright lights of Memphis,
                    E
and the Commodore Hotel
    E7           E                    E7       A
And underneath a street lamp, I met a southern belle
        D              A                         E
Oh, she took me to the river, where she cast her spell
            E7       E                        E7      A
And in that southern moonlight, she sang this song so well

          A                                          E
If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb
    E7            E              A  D A
And we can walk together down in Dixieland
E7      A  D A
Down in Dixieland

                A                              E
We made all the hotspots, my money flowed like wine
         E7                E                      E7     A
Then the low-down southern whiskey, yea, began to fog my mind
      D              A                                E
And I don t remember church bells, or the money I put down
       E7                     E
On the white picket fence and boardwalk
       E7           E      A
On the house at the end of town
        D          A                          E
Oh, but boy do I remember the strain of her refrain
        E7                E
And the nights we spent together
        E7      E         A
And the way she called my name

          A                                          E
If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb
    E7            E              A  D A
And we can walk together down in Dixieland
E7      A  D A
Down in Dixieland

A


      A
Well, many years since she ran away
                                  E
Yes that guitar player sure could play
    E7              E
She always liked to sing along
    E7     E            A
She always handy with a song
         D                A                        E
But then one night at the lobby of the Commodore Hotel
  E7                E             E7      E        A
I chanced to meet a bartender who said he knew her well
    D            A                            E
And as he handed me a drink he began to hum a song
    E7           E                    E7     E     A
And all the boys there, at the bar, began to sing along

          A                                          E
If you ll be my Dixie chicken I ll be your Tennessee lamb
    E7            E              A  D A
And we can walk together down in Dixieland
E7      A  D A
Down in Dixieland
