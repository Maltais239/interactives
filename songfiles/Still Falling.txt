Still Falling
Jeff McLellan
Key: C
Capo 7

C        G
And she, first kiss on New Year’s Eve
C        G
Had to go but I couldn’t leave.
C        G    Gb/G
So I stayed through the night, ‘til we got a little tight.
D
Just how much, no one knows.

C        G
So we, walked a deep canyon road.
C        G
In the autumn of the early snow.
C        G    Gb/G
That could cover our tracks, lost on our way back,
D
where the whispers go.

Em            C        D        G
I won’t waste my time worried there’s something else to find.
Em            C        D
You can search your life but it’ll pale compared to mine.
C        D
If it seems I’m stalling,

Em        G
I’m still falling.
Em        G
I’m still  falling.
Em        C    D
Falling for you girl.

C        G
How we, survive these sleepless nights.
C        G
Sleep walkers on night terror fright.
C        G        Gb/G
Just tuck ‘em back in bed and dishevel their heads
D
Until their eyes close.
C        G
Now we, sometimes just lock the door.
C        G
Trading sleep for something more.
C        G        Gb/G
We just hold through the night ‘til we’re feelin’ alright
D
‘til the morning glows.

Em        C        D        G
So I won’t waste my time worried there’s something else to find.
Em        C        D
You can search your life but it’ll pale compared to mine.
C        D
If it seems I’m stalling

Em        G
I’m still falling.
Em        G
I’m still falling.
C        D
Still fallin’ for you girl.
