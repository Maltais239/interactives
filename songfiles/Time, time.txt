Time, time

E                A     E
 Time, time, did I get enough?
A          E         B       E
Fill up my days, overfill my cup
E           A         E
Sigh, sigh, deepening dark
A        E           A        E
Dont let nothing put out that spark

Sons, daughters, keep your head down
Keep your eyes open, look all around
Your fleeting thoughts, dont let them stray
Hold them close so they can stay

Ch

Friend of mine, did I let our bond slip
Hold the ropes loose, you lose your grip
Clasp it tight, keep it in sight
Dark days aren't so dark
When your love is right

Love of mine, has it been so long
Since I wrote your dark eyes into my song
Love burns low unless it's fanned
Dont let it die out while you idly stand

Ch

Hey you on the dark road
Wondering where your soul it goes
When the hourglass is empty
and alone you sit
will you be proud of what you've done with it

Ch
