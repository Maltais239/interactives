Keep on Rockin' in the Free World
Neil Young
Key: Em



Intro:
Em   D  C
          (4x)

Em                   DC
Colors on the street
      Em            DC
Red, white and blue
        Em           D   C
People shufflin' their feet
         Em                    DC
People sleepin' in their shoes
                Em                  D    C
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
           Em                            D          C
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
       Em                     D   C
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
     Em                     D     C
So I try to forget it, any way I can.

A

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
(Bass only)
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler,
Machine gun hand
(Guitar starts in)
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive.
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world,
Keep on rockin' in the free world.
