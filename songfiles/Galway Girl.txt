Verse 1:

D
Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk

     D      A    G
On a day -I-ay-I-ay

D
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk

     D         G      D
On a fine soft day -I-ay

      G          D               G        D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do

            Bm       A            G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue

        G         D           G         D
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl

            Bm       A           G      D
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

Verse 2:

D
We were halfway there when the rain came down

                 G
On a day -I-ay-I-ay

        D
And she asked me up to her flat downtown

     D          G          D
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay

      G        D                G        D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do

            Bm       A            G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue

      G        D          G          D
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl

       Bm      A         G      D
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

Verse 3:

D                                          G
When I woke up I was all alone

         D                              G  D
With a broken heart and a ticket home

      G        D            G             D
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do

        Bm         A          G          D
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue

G        D              GD
                        
'Cause I've traveled around. I've been all over this world

              Bm         A             G      D
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
