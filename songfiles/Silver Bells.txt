Silver Bells
Bing Crosby
Key: G
     G
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
           C
Dressed in Holiday style
       D             D7         G
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
         G
Children laughing, people passing
        C
Meeting smile after smile
       D            D7         G
And on every street corner you hear

G             C
Silver bells, silver bells
D              D7          G
It's Christmas-time in the city
G            C
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
D            D7           G
Soon it will be Christmas Day


           G
Strings of street lights, even stop lights
        C
Blink a bright red and green
       D            D7              G
As the shoppers run home with their treasures
       G
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
        C
This is Santa's big scene
     D            D7         G
And above all the bustle you hear...


G             C
Silver bells, silver bells
D              D7          G
It's Christmas-time in the city
G            C
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
D            D7           G
Soon it will be Christmas Day
