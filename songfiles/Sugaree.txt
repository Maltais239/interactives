G                  C
When they come to take you down
G                    C
when they bring that wagon 'round
G                   C
When they come to call on you
G                 C
and drag your poor body down

G                      C
You thought you was the cool fool
G                  C
and never could do no wrong
G                   C
Had everything sewed up tight.
G                      C
how come you lay awake all night long

Well in spite of all you had gained
G                              C
