Key: G
Tempo: 96 BPM

no chord

                       G   CG
There's a spark in the dark
              C
A fire in the trees
                 D                               G CG
And your shining eyes in the shadows waiting for me

                   G        CG
What's between the silences
             C
Ain't easily heard
              D
We cover it up
                        G    CG
With old used lines and words


no chord   G
So hand it over
                  C
Your cruel, cruel heart
            D
Hand it over
              G
Before I fall apart

           G
Love never flies
                     C
In a straight narrow line
                     D
It's curved and it's twisted
                    G
And it comes at the wrong time


no chord   G
So hand it over
                  C
Your cruel, cruel heart
            D
Hand it over
              G
Before I fall apart

Wes solo

When your voice is lifted
                         C
And the tears and sparks fly
             D
Remember the fire that will rage in the cage
                        G
and will burn when it's dry


no chord   G
So hand it over
                  C
Your cruel, cruel heart
            D
Hand it over
              G
Before I fall apart
