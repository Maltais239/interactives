Every Other Cliché
Darren Maltais

I knew this girl, she had a heart of gold
And a kiss that would steal your soul
But she faded out, like a meteorite
But the light she left still burns in the night

Not much I can do
But remember you
Not much I can say
I remember you like it was yesterday

I met this guy, the kind you dont forget soon
Standing in a leaky boat under a Gambier moon
He had a wild, wild philosophy
The books he read were his only company

Not much he could say
But I'm better off this way
Not much he could do
But hide himself away from me and you

I knew this guy; he'd call himself your friend
But he wasnt there in the end
He snuck out of town
Like a thief would do
Without a trace, without a sound and
Especially without a clue

Not much I can do
Try my best to get along with you
Not much I can say
But forgive and forget and
Every other cliché
