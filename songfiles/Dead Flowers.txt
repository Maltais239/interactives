D                        A             G                D
Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
D               A                  G   D
Talking to some rich folk that you know
D                         A        G           D
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
D                      A         G   D
Cause you know I could never be alone

        A                          D
Take me down little Susie, take me down
A                                             D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can
G                          D
send me dead flowers every morning
G                           D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G                          D
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
      D                   A             G    D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

D                        A            G              D
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink cadillac
D              A              G  D
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
D                          A           G            D
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
D                   A             G  D
And another girl to take my pain away

        A                          D
Take me down little Susie, take me down
A                                             D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can
G                          D
send me dead flowers every morning
G                           D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G                          D
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
      D                   A             G    D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Take me down little Susie, take me down
A                                             D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can
G                          D
send me dead flowers every morning
G                               D
Send me dead flowers by the U S mail
G                              D
Say it with dead flowers at my wedding
      D                   A             G    D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
      D                   A             G    D
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave
