Eyes Of Sarah Jane
Jayhawks
Key: G



G           Cm
Warwick Hotel
G         Cm
I know it well
G                D#               C          G
We lived a dream so sweet, so sweet

G                                       Cm
I see Philly in the snowy gloom
G                                          Cm
We could have laid there 'til afternoon
G                  D#              C         G
Our cut runs deep, so deep, so deep

Chorus:
                  F
And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
                 A#                   F
I see the happy times again
                    F
And in the eyes of Sarah Jane
                    A#                   G
I see the happy times again

(Same chords as previous verse)
We couldn't sleep
Laugh 'til we weep
Then time stood still, so still, so still

Talked for hours in our little bed
I fell in love with every word you said
It felt so great, so great, so great

Chorus

Solo: G# E C#   2x

Bridge:
G#
People love to fall in
D#
Love they love to fall in
A#                                C
People love to be amused
G#
But you won't see me laughing
D#                                    G      Cm  G  Cm
In the sadness of our ways

G                       Cm
Those were the days
G                          Cm
Those were the days

Chorus x2

End on G#
