Just about a year ago, I set out on the road,
                   Em       C                   D
Seekin my fame and fortune, lookin for a pot of gold.
G                   Em                  C                       G
Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will know the tune.
G    G     D              C   G
Oh ! lord, stuck in Lodi again.

G                                 C               G
Rode in on the Greyhound, I’ll be walkin out if I go.
                  Em               C               D
I was just passin through, must be seven months or more.
G                   Em     C                       G
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends.
G    G         D              C   G
Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.

G                         C                G
The man from the magazine said I was on my way.
                   Em         C                   D
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play.
G                   Em               C                        G
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through
G    G     D              C   G
Oh ! lord, stuck in Lodi again.

Mmmm...

A                           D               A
If I only had a dollar, for every song I’ve sung.
                    F#m               D                E
And every time I’ve had to play while people sat there drunk.
    A                   F#m         D               A
You know, I'd catch the next train, back to where I live.
A    A         E              D   A
Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.
A    A         E              D   A
Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.
