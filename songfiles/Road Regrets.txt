Road Regrets
Dan Mangan
Key: G


Verse 1
      G
We’ll drive until the gas is gone
     C
Then walk until our feet our torn
Am
Crawl until we feed the soil
C
Film the whole thing

         G
It’s all business in the left hand lane
      C
Drive there and then drive back again
 Am
Escape can’t be the only way
  C
To escape

        G
So I’ve gotten used to coffee sweats
      C
Still getting used to road regrets
       Am
Hell I took you up on all your threats
C
To leave


Chorus 1
       G
It’s a shame, it’s a crying shame
          C
Thems the breaks
                        Am
And ain’t it always the way
                                            C
That takes you back to from where it is you came


Verse 2
G
Robby like’s his country tune
           C
It’s never been the lens that I see through
            Am
But I guess driving for a week or two
     C
Puts words in your mouth

        G
So find dodge and then get out of it
      C
It’s about as country as I can get
              Am
See you ain’t living till you’re living it
           C
You’re not dead till you die

    G
But watch out for the paraphrase
              C
Cos they will crown you then they will take your legs
        Am
See the cost is more than what you get paid
C
But do it anyway


Chorus 2
       G
It’s a shame, it’s a crying shame
          C
Thems the breaks
                        Am
And ain’t it always the way
                                            C
That takes you back to from where it is you came
