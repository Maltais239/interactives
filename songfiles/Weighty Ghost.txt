Verse


E            Aadd9 E
I got out of bed today,
Aadd9                          E
Swear to God I couldn't see my face
E            Aadd9 E
I got out of bed today
Aadd9                         E
staring at a ghost


Verse


E             Aadd9  E
Who forgot to float away,
Aadd9                        E
didn't have all that much to say
E                     Aadd9   E
Wouldn't even tell me his own name
    Aadd9                     E
And where'd my body go?


Ahorus


E                   Aadd9 E
Where oh where'd my body  go?
Aadd9         E
Africa or Mexico?
E             Aadd9 E
Oh where'd my body go?
Aadd9                         E
And where did my body go?


Ahorus


E            Aadd9   E
Oh, have you seen my ghost?
Aadd9                  E
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost?
E            Aadd9   E
Oh, have you seen my ghost?
Aadd9                         E
Staring at the ground?

E            Aadd9   E
Oh, have you seen my ghost?
Aadd9                E
See my ghost, see my ghost
E            Aadd9   E
Oh, have you seen my ghost?
Aadd9                   E
Sick of those goddamn clouds

Verse


E                    Aadd9    E
Are you some kind of medicine man?
Aadd9                    E
Cut the demons out of my head
E                               Aadd9   E
You can't kill something that's already dead
Aadd9                         E
So leave my soul alone


Verse


E               Aadd9 E
I don't need no surgery
Aadd9                       E
Take those knives away from me
E                    Aadd9  E
Just wanna die in my own body
  Aadd9                       E
A ghost just needs a home

Staring at the ground?
