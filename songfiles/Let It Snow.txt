        C          G7      C
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
        C       Ebdim       G
But the fire is so   delightful,
    Dm             A7       Dm
And since we've no place to go,
       G7                        C    G
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

It doesn't show signs of stopping,
      C            Ebdim       G
And I brought some corn for popping.
    Dm                A7       Dm
The lights are turned way down low,
       G7                        C    G
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night,
         Am         D7         G
How I'll hate going out in the storm.
       G
But if you really hold me tight,
A7          D7           G
All the way home I'll be warm.

    C       G7     C
The fire is slowly dying,
        C            Ebdim            G
And, my dear, we're still    good - byeing,
       Dm          A7      Dm
But as long as you love me so.
       G7                        C
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
