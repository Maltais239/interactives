Sky Blue
fingerstyle
Key: A

A            D  A     D          A
I'd settled in for a long, long storm
When the clouds rolled in and the lightning warned
Us away
The path I'm on ain't the one I'd begun
I walked closer when I should have run
Far away
     Bm      E
From you, oh you
                 A
Bright clear sky blue

Have you forgotten the things that you knew?
And what you held dear now you see right through
Some unexpected things can happen too
I was struck by a shooting star while looking up to
Up to you
Bm      E
You, oh you
                 A
Bright clear sky blue

Bm       D                               A
Have you said all the things you have to say
Bm           D                      F#m E
When you're gone you can't say Oh,wait.
                                     A
There are second chances but not for me today

You'd think by now I would have learned
You look up at that blue sky oh man your eyes will get burned
Just when I thought that the weather had turned
I looked up and saw that the sun had returned
     Bm      E
With You, oh you
                 A
Bright clear sky blue
     Bm      E
With You, oh you
                 A
Bright clear sky blue
