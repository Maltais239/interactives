Just Like A Women
Bob Dylan
Key: G



  G    C     D7    G
Nobody feels any pain

              C    D7            G
Tonight as I stand inside the rain

C          D7
Everybody knows

C#7                  D7
That Baby's got new clothes

      C  Bm     Am   G      D7
But late-ly     I   see her ribbons and her bows

Dm      F  Bb   C11   |  C7  |  C9  |  C7
Have fallen from her curls


Chorus:

D7    G    Bm   Am  G C
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does

      G         Bm   Am  G C
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does

          G    Bm   Am  G C#
And she aches just like a woman

        D11    D7          D9     D7  G
But she breaks just like a little     girl.

Verse 2

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Noboby has to guess,
That baby can't be blessed,
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest.
With her fog,
Her amphetamines
And her pearls

Chorus

Bridge :

       B7
It was raining from the first


And I was dying of thirst

     G
So I came in here

        B7
And you long time curse hurts

                        C
But whats worse is this pain in here

D11      D7         D9  D6
 I can't stay in here

D11      D7   D9 D7
Ain't it   clear that

Verse 3
I just can't fit.
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit.
And when we meet again,
Introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when,
I was hungry,
And it was your world then.

Chorus   | Bb F Bb C | F


Be seeing you,
Kelwyn.

JUST LIKE A WOMAN by Bob Dylan

D      G     A   D
Nobody feels any pain
D            G     A          D
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
G         A          G              A
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
    G   F#mEm D      G               A
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
     Bm     D        A
Have fallen from her curls

    D     F#m         G
She takes just like a woman, yes she does
    D          F#m         G
She makes love just like a woman, yes she does
        D     F#m         G
And she aches just like a woman
        A                             D
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.

CHORUS

F#7
It was rainin' from the first and I was dying there of thirst
     D
So I came in here
F#7
And your longtime curse hurts but what's worse
        G                     Em
Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here,
G
Ain't it clear

That I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.
