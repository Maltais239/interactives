Verse 1

E                  B
  I don’t mind you coming here
C#m              G#
  Wasting all my time
E                             B
  ‘Cause when you’re standing oh so near
C#m                 G#
  I kind of lose my mind
E                      B
  It’s not the perfume that you wear
C#m                    G#
  It’s not the ribbons in your hair
E                  B
  I don’t mind you coming here

E                  B
  I don’t mind you hanging out
C#m                  G#
  And talking in your sleep
E                   B
  It doesn’t matter where you’ve been
C#m                 G#
  As long as it was deep, yeah
E                    B
  You always knew to wear it well    and
C#m                 G#
  You look so fancy I can tell
E                  B

  And talking in your sleep
