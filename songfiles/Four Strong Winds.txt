Chorus

            G               Am            D             G
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
          G                 Am               D     D7
All those things that don't change come what may
        G                  Am            D                G
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
          C              Em             D
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Verse

           G           Am               D                 G
Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
           G                  Am            D    D7
I got some friends that I can go to working for
        G                      Am         D                  G
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
          C                   Em               D
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Chorus

            G               Am            D             G
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
          G                 Am               D     D7
All those things that don't change come what may
        G                  Am            D                G
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
          C              Em             D
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Verse

     G                    Am                 D                G
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are going good
          G            Am                D     D7
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
       G                Am              D               G
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do
          C                   Em           D
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Chorus

            G               Am            D             G
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
          G                 Am               D     D7
All those things that don't change come what may
        G                  Am            D                G
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
          C              Em             D
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
