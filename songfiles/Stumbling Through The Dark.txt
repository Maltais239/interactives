Key: G




Intro
GF#mEmA
   
GF#mEmA
   
D           F#m               G3
You're so in love, little girl
             F#m
So much in love little girl
 Em       A               Bm
Running around in circles why?
                  A7
You know it's a crime

 D           F#m
No less no more than a rose
G3      F#m
No less no more than a rose
 Em       A         Bm
Try to attach a meaning
                     A7
To words that you've heard


Chorus:
 G           Em         A
Stumbling through the dark
 G           Em                  A
Seems I'm stumbling through the dark
 G             Em                A-Amaj7-Asus2
Everybody's stumbling through the dark

 D            F#m
The men who proceeded us here
G3        F#m
Left only questions and fears
 Em            A             Bm
The vanity formed by beauty lies
                  A7
You know it's a crime

Repeat chorus
