The wheel
Grateful Dead
Key: D



     D                                   G
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
     D                               G
You can't let go and you can't hold on
     D                                  G
You can't go back and you can't stand still
         C                               F      G
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

C F G  C F G
             BRIDGE:
  C                   F            G
Won't you try just a little bit harder
  C                       F
Couldn't you try just a little bit more
  C                     F
Won't you try just a little bit harder
  C                       F
Couldn't you try just a little bit more
  D
Round, round, robin run around
                        A
Gotta get back to where you belong
    D
A little bit harder just a little bit more
    A                          D
A little bit farther than you gone before
CHORUS
 G                           C
Small wheel turning by the firing rod
  G                        C
Big wheel turning by the grace of God
  G               C
Every time that wheel turn round
  G
Bound to cover just a little more ground
(n.c.)
Bound to cover just a little more ground
