All Along The Watchtower
To match the key of C# minor of Dylan's studio recording from "John Wesley Harding"
Key: Am
put on a capo 4th fret.

(My tip is to play the 2nd G chord in each line with open strings x-0-0-0-0-0
and play the F chords as Fmaj7/C x-3-3-2-1-0)

Verse 1
Am             G        F           G
 There must be some way out of here
Am        G            F         G
 Said the joker to the thief
Am           G       F      G
 There's too much confusion
Am       G        F     G
 I can't get no relief
Am        G        F            G
 Business men they drink my wine
Am       G      F      G
 Plowmen dig my earth
Am       G     F             G
 None of them along the line
Am         G            F     G
 Know what any of it is worth

Am         G        F    G
 No reason to get excited
Am           G       F      G
 The thief he kindly spoke
Am         G          F        G
 There are many here among us
Am             G             F      G
 Who feel that life is but a joke
Am           G       F                 G
 But you and I we've been through that
Am          G        F       G
 And this is not our fate
Am         G        F           G
 So let us not talk falsely now
Am          G        F       G
 The hour is getting late

Am    G        F       G
 All along the watchtower
Am          G         F       G
 The princes kept the view
Am             G     F            G
 While all the women came and went,
Am        G         F       G
 Barefoot servants, too.
Am       G      F      G
 Outside in the distance
Am      G       F    G
 A wild cat did growl
Am          G     F          G
 Two riders were approaching
Am         G       F    G
 The wind began to howl
