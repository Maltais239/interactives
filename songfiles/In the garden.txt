In the garden
Gospel standard
Key: G



G                         G7
I come to the garden alone
           C                   G
While the dew is still on the roses
         D                   G     Em
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
    A             D     D7
The son of God discloses

(chorus)
        G                    D
And he walks with me and he talks with me
                         G
And he tells me I am his own
                B       Em  C
And the joy we share as we tarry there
  G           D     G
None other has ever known.

G                                   G7
He speaks and the sound of his voice
      C                               G
Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
        D              G       Em
And the melody that he gave to me
  A                 D     D7
Within my heart is ringing

(repeat chorus)

G                              G7
I'd stay in the garden with Him
             C                G
Though the night around me be falling
        D                       G       Em
But He bids me go, through the voice of woe
   A                 D      D7
His voice to me, is calling,
(repeat chorus)
