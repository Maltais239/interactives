Lovers in a Dangerous Time by BNL
Key: G

I've seen a couple versions of this song out there but most incorrectly
have a
capo on the third fret. There's a good clip of Ed on Youtube playing with
a capo
on 2 and the chords are pretty easy to make out. Hammer on and pull off
the middle
finger on the G-string when playing the Fmaj7 to get the riff right.

Verse

G                      Am7                    Fmaj7
  Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by?
G                 Am7               Fmaj7
  We never get to stop and open our eyes.
G                   Am7                     Fmaj7
  One minute you're waiting for the sky to fall
G                            Am7            Fmaj7
  Next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all.


Chorus

G  Am7                Fmaj7

Verse

G               Am7                    Fmaj7
  These fragile bodies of touch and taste
G               Am7                    Fmaj7
  This fragrant skin, this hair like lace
G         Am7                  Fmaj7
  Spirits open to thrust of grace,
G            Am7                       Fmaj7
  Never a breath you can't afford to waste.


Chorus

Verse

G             Am7                     Fmaj7
  When you're lovers in a dangerous time,
G                               Am7                  Fmaj7
  Sometimes you're made to feel as if your loves a crime.
G                              Am7                Fmaj7
Nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight
G                         Am7                     Fmaj7
  You gotta kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight.


Chorus

  We were lovers in a dangerous time
     G           Am7         Fmaj7
Lo-o-overs, Lo-o-overs, Lo-o-overs
     G        Am7      Fmaj7
Woah-oh, Oo-woah, Woah-oh
