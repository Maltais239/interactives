        C                         F                 C
I don't need a lot of presents to make my Christmas bright,
F                          C
I just need my baby's arms wound around me tight.

(TACET) Oh Santa,

G7            F               G7           C
Hear my plea. Santa, bring my baby back to me.

    C                            F            C
The Christmas tree is ready, the candles all aglow,
    F                          C
But with my baby far away what good is mistletoe?

(TACET) Oh Santa,

G7            F               G7           C    C7
Hear my plea. Santa, bring my baby back to me.


       F                              C
Please make these reindeer hurry; the time is drawin' near.
   D7                                G7
It sure won't seem like Christmas unless
                  G7
(TACET) my baby's here.

      C                           F                C
Don't fill my sock with candy, no bright and shiny toy.
    F                       C
You wanna make me happy and fill my heart with joy,

(TACET) Then, Santa,
