Verse
                       Dm
In the morning when I wake
F                     C
And the sun is coming through,
                           Dm
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness,
F                         C
And you fill my head with you.

                       Dm
Shall I write it in a letter?
F                     C
Shall I try to get it down?
                          Dm
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
F                     C              (stop)
Of a song I can't get out.


Chorus
                   Dm
Can I be close to you?
           F              C
Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh.
                  Dm
Can I be close to you?

Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh.


Verse
                    Dm
Can I take it to a moment
F                            C
Where the fields are painted gold
                              Dm
And the trees are filled with memories
F                     C
Of the feelings never told?

                           Dm
When the evening pulls the sun down,
 F                    C
And the day is almost through,
                           Dm
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping,
F               C                            (stop)
But my world is you.

Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh.
