Verse 1

C                F
Sometimes in our lives
            C
We all have pain
            Em G
We all have sorrow
C             F
But if we are wise
             C                G7 C
We know that there's always tomorrow


Chorus

          C                 F
Lean on me, when you're not strong

And I'll be your friend
              Em    G
I'll help you carry on
C               F
For it won't be long

'Til I'm gonna need

Somebody to lean on


Verse 2

C                   F
Please swallow your pride
          C
If I have things
            Em G
You need to borrow
C              F
For no one can fill
              C
Those of your needs
               G7  C
That you won't let show

We all need somebody to lean on

C             F
If there is a load

you have to bear
               Em G
That you can't carry

I'm right up the road

I'll share your load

If you just call me (call me)
