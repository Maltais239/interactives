They met in a hurricane

Standing in the shelter out of the rain

She tucked a note into his hand
Em
Later on they took his car
D
Drove on down where the beaches are
Am                       C
He wrote her name in the sand

Never even let go of her hand

Somehow they stayed that way

For those 5 days in May
Am                               C
Made all the stars around them shine
Em
Funny how you can look in vain
D
Living on nerves and such sweet pain
Am                            C
The loneliness that cuts so fine
G                        F            C     D
To find the face you've seen a thousand times


Chorus
C
Sometimes the world begins
C
To set you up on your feet again
Bm                           D
It wipes the tears from your eyes
C
How will you ever know
C
The way that circumstances go
Bm                         D
Always gonna hit you by surprise
  Am
I know my past
G/B
You were there

Verse 3
Em
Looking back it's hard to tell
D
Why they stood while others fell
Am                          C
Spend your life working it out
Em
All I know is one cloudy day
D
They both just ran away
Am                              C
Rain on the windshield heading south
 G            F                 C   D
Oh she loved the lines around his mouth
