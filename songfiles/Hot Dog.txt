Intro
Aww hot dog
G
Well I just got in to town today,
C
To find my girl has gone away,
G                                     D
She took the Greyhound in the general store.

G
I searched myself, I searched the town,
C
And when I finally did set down,
G                 D          G
I found myself no wiser than before.

She said we couldn't do no wrong,
No other love could be so strong,
She locked up my heart in the bottom drawer.

Now, she took my heart, and she took my keys,
From in my old blue dungarees,
And I'll never love old Texas anymore.

D                        G
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do,
D                                         G
She took my love and walked right out the door.
C                             G
And if I ever find that girl, I know one thing for sure,
C                                     D
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before.

I took her love at seventeen,
A little late these days, it seems
they said heaven's well ....

I took her word, I took it all,
Beneath the sign that said UHaul
she lft angels hanging 'round for more

solo
D                        G
Now my baby's gone, I don't know what to do,
D                                         G
She took my love and walked right out the door.
C                             G
And if I ever find that girl, I know one thing for sure,
C                                     D
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before.

I thought I had it all sewn up,
a love, a plot, a pickup truck
But folks said she was after something more

I never did quite understand
All that talk about a rockin band
They just Rolled my doll right out the door
