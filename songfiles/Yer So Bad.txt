              D      G         Am
My sister got lucky, married a yuppie
             D          G
Took him for all he was worth
    Am      D        G        Am
Now she's a swinger, dating a singer;
          D             G
I can't decide which is worse

    Em  C   G  D            Em  C  G    D
But not me, ba by, I've got you to save me
    G   D  C    G            D    C
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
     G     D    C    G   D  C   D
In a world gone mad, yer so bad

   Am          D        G            Am
My sister's ex-husband, can't get no lovin';
             D             G
walks around dog-faced and hurt
Am           D        G           Am
Now he's got nothin', head in the oven;
          D             G
I can't decide which is worse

    Em  C   G  D            Em  C  G    D
But not me, ba by, I've got you to save me
    G   D  C    G            D    C
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
     G     D    C    G   D  C   D
In a world gone mad, yer so bad

But not me, ba by, I've got you to save me
    G   D  C    G            D    C
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had

In a world gone mad, yer so bad

Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
     G     D    C    G   D  C   D
In a world gone mad, yer so bad
