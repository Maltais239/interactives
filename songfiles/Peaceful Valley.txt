Peaceful Valley
Ryan Adams
Key: A



A
Lord take me home
                A7
To the peaceful valley
A
 Down the winding river
       G       D
To the city of souls
A
I've grown so tired
                    A7
And my hearts grown heavy
A
To walk any longer
        G         D
To your cities of gold
Em     G         D         A
All my life I've onged for forgiveness
    Em          G           D
But I can never seem to get enough
Em     G              D               A
All my life I've been rocked into the darkness
Em               G
With a gun to my head
D                         G
Trying to find a peaceful song
D                          G
 Trying to find a peaceful song
D                            G
To sing when everything goes wrong
         D               D7
Till the peaceful valley calls me home
A
Up there in the clouds
        A7
In that glorious kingdom
A                                  G    D
Tell me there ain't nothing but an easy recline
A                                           A7
Can I still smoke my cigarettes and have my coffee
                          G         D
Up there in heaven with a bottle of wine
Em     G         D         A
All my life I've onged for forgiveness
    Em          G           D
But I can never seem to get enough
Em     G              D               A
All my life I've been rocked into the darkness
Em               G
With a gun to my head
D                         G
Trying to find a peaceful song
D                          G
 Trying to find a peaceful song
D                            G
To sing when everything goes wrong
         D               D7
Till the peaceful valley calls me home
A                               A7
Oh take me home to the peaceful valley
A
Down the winding rivers
        G       D
To your city of souls
