A   G                   D
hey let them follow you down
D        A      E             D
way underground, wind and he`s bound
A      G             D
bound to follow you down
D           A    E               D
just a deadbeat, right off the street
A     G               D
bound to follow you down

A       G             D
though ball rooms and smelly bordellos
        A             G                D
and dressing rooms filled with parasites
      A         G                D
on stage, the band has got problems
        A         D           A           A D A
they're a bag of nerves on first nights


Interlude

A        G           D
he ain't tied down to no home town
yeah and you thought he was reckless
you think hes bad, he thinks you're mad
yeah, and the guitar player looks reckless


Chorus

A        G       D
well his coat is torn and frayed
      A       G           D
and its seen much better days
       A           G          D
just as long as the guitar plays
        A          D          A      A D A
let its steal your heart away

Joes got a cough, sounds kind of rough
A      G                   D
yeah, got the codine to fix it
D           A     E            D
Doctor prescribes drugstore supplies
A           G             D
