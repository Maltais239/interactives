Fishermans Blues
Waterboys
Key: G



G        F         Am          C
                               
play it twice

1st verse:

G                         F
I wish I was a fisherman, tumbling on the sea
Am                               C
Far away from dry land, and it's bitter memories
G                              F
Casting you my sweet line with abandonment and love
Am                                       C
No ceiling staring down on me, save the starry sky above

Chorus:
                 G     F             Am            C
With light in my head, and you in my arms, woo woo ooh


2nd verse:

I wish I was the brake man, on a hurtling fevered train
Crashing headlong into the heartland, like a cannon in the rain
With the beating of the sleepers, and the burning of the coal
Counting the towns flashing by me, in a night that's full of soul

Chorus:

G                          F
I know I will be loosened, from bonds that hold me fast
Am                                     C
And the chains all hung around me will fall away at last
G                                       F
And on that fine and fateful day I will take me in my hands
Am                                C
I will ride on that train, I will be the fisherman

Repeat chorus
