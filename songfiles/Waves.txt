Waves
Darren Maltais

Will those dark waves
Wash us up on shore
Is there a word of hope
Within the oceans roar
Those parting clouds
Will show the light once more
And well know what's to come
By what has gone before

Will lightning strike
And brightly cause a flame
Or rainfall dampen
and dim what little light remains
that gasoline poured on
makes it burn hard and fast
but you might get burned
and the flame wont last
