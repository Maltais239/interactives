Intro:  E  C#m (x2)
E
Hey little girl is your daddy home
                                                                    A
Did he go away and leave you all alone   Mmm-hmm
                      C#m
I got a bad desire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire

E
Tell me now baby is he good to you
                                                                  A
Can he do to you the things I donÕt do  Mmm-hmm
                       C#m
I can take you higher
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire

E C#m(x2)
   

                              A
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
                                    E
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
                    C#m
through the middle of my soul

     E
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
and a freight train running through the
middle of my head
         A                          C#m
Only you can cool my desire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire

E C#m(x4)
