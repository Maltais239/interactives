You Don't Know How It Feels
Tom Petty
Key: E




E A E A
      
E               A                 E             A
Let me run with you tonight, I'll take you on a moonlight ride
E A E A
      
E                 A                E                A
There's someone I used to see, but she don't give a damn for me
E A E A
      


           E          B            E            A
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
             E     B              E          A
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
E         D           A
You don't know how it feels
E         D           A              E
You don't know how it feels... to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up
in between
Memory and a dream

CHORUS

My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the
clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

CHORUS
