Sparrow And The Wolf
verse 1
Key: C

C
sparrow and wolf lay as still as the blades of the grass
Am                          F                          C
like worn leather boots, of colour and size that would last

C
caught them a lark in a trap, and each held a wing
          Am            F                             C
then they tore it apart, before that small bird could sing

C
confused by the wind, bruised by the size of the rain
    Am               F                       C
she turned in to him, begged for the light to remain
C
but plans have been made, all the furniture sold
    Am                F                              C
so store up your hate, use it for warmth when you're cold

chorus

F
for I have seen no joy, only danger,
C
I see no joy, only strangers,
G                               F
I see no joy, see no joy in this world
F
should you, choose to go, please be careful of,
C
lonesome roads, men who travel them,
G                                   F
will not know, will not know of your ways

F
oh-oo-oh
Dm
oh-oo-oh
F
oh-oo-oh
Dm      F
oh-oo-oh

chorus 2

F
still I have, seen no joy, only dangers, I
C
see no joy, only strangers, I
G                              F
see no joy, see no joy in this world,

you should choose to go, please remember what
C
you have learned, from the little bird,
G                              F
always dear, always dear to my heart
