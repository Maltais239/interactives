Walls
Tom Petty
Key: G


G
Some days are diamonds
Em
Some days are rocks
C
Some doors are open
D
Some roads are blocked

G
Sun downs are golden
Em
Then fade away
C
But if I never do nothing
D
I'll get you back some day

                C        G
Cause you got a heart so big
         C          G
It could crush this town
            Am          Em
And I can't hold out forever
     D          G
Even walls fall down

    G
And all around your island
Em
There's a barricade
C
It keeps out the danger
D
It holds in the pain

G
Sometimes you're happy
Em
Sometimes you cry
C
Half of me is ocean
D
Half of me is sky

                C        G
Cause you got a heart so big
         C          G
It could crush this town
            Am          Em
And I can't hold out forever
     D          G
Even walls fall down

Solo:
G Em C D x2

    G
And some things are over
Em
Some things go on
 C
And part of me you carry
D
Part of me is gone


                C        G
Cause you got a heart so big
         C          G
It could crush this town
            Am          Em
And I can't hold out forever
     D          G
Even walls fall down

                C        G
Baby, you got a heart so big
         C          G
It could crush this town
            Am       Em
And I can't hold out forever
      D        G
Even walls fall down
