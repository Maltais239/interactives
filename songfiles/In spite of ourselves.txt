HIS VERSE
C
She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
    F
She looks down her nose at money
    C
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
G
She's my baby, I'm her honey
                        C  GC
I'm never gonna let her go

HER VERSE
C
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
   F
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
C
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
G
He's my baby, And I'm his honey
                    C  G C
Never gonna let him go

COMBO CHORUS
            F
In spite of ourselves
                            C
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
            G
Against all odds
                          C     G C
Honey, we're the big door prize
            F
We're gonna spite our noses
                 C
Right off of our faces
                                   G
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
               C     G C
Dancin' in our eyes.

HIS VERSE
C
She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
    F
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
C
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
G
She takes a lickin' but she keeps on tickin'
                        C   G C
I'm never gonna let her go.

HER VERSE
C
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
F
He's sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
C
When payday comes, he's howlin' at the moon
G
But he's my baby.  I don't mean maybe
                    C  GC
Never gonna let him go

            F
In spite of ourselves
                            C
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
            G
Against all odds
                          C     G C
Honey, we're the big door prize
            F
We're gonna spite our noses
                 C
Right off of our faces
                                   G
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
               C      G F C
Dancin' in our eyes.

Repeat chorus

                                   G
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
               C      G F C
Dancin' in our eyes.
