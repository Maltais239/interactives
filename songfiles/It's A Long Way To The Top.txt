It's A Long Way To The Top
Ac/Dc
Key: A



A

Riding down the highway
Going to a show
Stop in all the by-ways
Playing rock 'n' roll
Getting robbed
Getting stoned
Getting beat up
Broken boned
Getting had
Getting took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

Chorus:
       A               G             D           A
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll       x 2
       A                                      D
If you think it's easy doing one night stands
Try playing in a rock 'n' roll band
       G               D                            A
It's a long way to the top if you wanna to rock 'n' roll

Break:

GDA
       x 4

A
                                             Quiet
Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Getting old                                     Heavy
Getting grey
Getting ripped off
Under paid
Getting sold
Second hand
That's how it goes, playing in a band

Chorus:
       A               G             D           A
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll       x 2
       A                                   D
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
       G               D                            A
It's a long way to the top if you wanna to rock 'n' roll       x 4

It's a long way                         Repeat & ad-lib
