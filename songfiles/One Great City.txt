Verse

D/F#               C                        G
  Late afternoon, another day is nearly done
D/F#               C                              G
  A darker grey is breaking through a lighter one
D/F#                   C                         G
  A thousand sharpened elbows in the underground
D/F#                 C
  That hollow hurried sound

Chorus

Em      D/F#     C
Feet on polished floor
    Em     D/F#   C
And in the dollar store
    Em       D/F#    A
The clerk is closing up
                                   C
And counting loonies trying not to say
       G
I hate Winnipeg

Verse

D/F#                     C                         G
   The driver checks the mirror seven minutes late
D/F#                   C                         G
   The crowded riders' restlessness enunciates
D/F#                         C                      G
   The Guess Who sucked, the Jets were lousy anyway
D/F#                 C
The same route everyday

Chorus

    Em     D/F#    C
And in the turning lane
Em        D/F#     C
Someone's stalled again
     Em      D/F#  A
He's talking to himself
                                      C
And hears the price of gas repeat his phrase
       G
I hate Winnipeg

Chorus

    Em  D/F#    C
And up above us all
Em      D/F# C
Leaning into sky
    Em     D/F#     C
Our golden business boy
     Em        D/F#      C
Will watch the North End die
    Em       D/F#      A
And sing, “I love this town”
                                  C
Then let his arcing wrecking ball proclaim

C       D/F#        G
I       Hate        Winnipeg

G
