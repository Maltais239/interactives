Key: G



G                    C                 G                  C
Oh I'd rather go and journey where the diamond crests are flowing and
G              C          G              C
Run across the valley beneath the sacred mountains  and
D
Wander  thru  the forest
            C
Where the trees have leaves of prisims and  break the light in colors
     D                G                C   G  C
That no-one knows the names of
    G                   C              G           C
And when it's time I'll go and wait beside a legendary fountain
G               C              G                 C
Till I see your form reflected in it's clear and jeweled water
    D
And if you think I'm ready
        C
You may lead me to the castles where the rivers of our vision
     D         G         C    G     C    D
Flow into one another
G              C               G               C
I will want to die beneath the white cascading waters
        G           C             G              C
She may beg she may plead she may argue with her logic
     D
And mention all the things I lose
     C
That really have no value in the end she will surely know
  D                 G
I wasn't born to follow
