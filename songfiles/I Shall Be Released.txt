E                          F#m
They say everything can be replaced

G#m               A      B      E
 They say every distance is not near

E                   F#m/E
So I remember every face

G#m/E     A       B      E
 Of every man who put me here.

E                   F#m/E
I see my light come shining

G#m/E     A    B        E
 From the west unto the east.

E
 Any day now,

F#m/E
 Any day now,

G#m/EA     B       E
  I shall be released

They say every man needs protection.
They every man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
Somewhere so high above the wall.
I see my light come shining,
>From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I shall be released.

Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
A man who swears he not to blame.
All day long I hear him cry shouting loud,
Calling out that he's been framed.
I see my light come shining,
>From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I shall be released.
