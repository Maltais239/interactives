G           D                C             G
You are so far away on this cold empty night,
                D                C               D
As I lie in a hotel room looking at the street light.
G            D         C            G
Outside my window I listen to the rain,
                         D                         C
And the sounds of the passing cars ,   and the waves
            F       D
on English Ba-----ay

         G             D           C            G
And I wonder if you think of me as I dream of you.
                       D              C         D
Do you hear the song that I sing in this hotel room?
         G                 D                C             G
Cause I see you in the stars above and in every setting sun,
                                         D
and even though you're fifteen hundred miles away,
         C                F        D
I hear you howling at the mo-----on

       G                D
And I hold you in my mind,
        C               G
and I start to float away
                             D
Yeah, the whole world seems very strange
     C                   D
in a pleasant kind ah way

     G                   D
And as the morning sun comes up
              C                  G
and puts an end to this long night,
              D        C                D
more than anything, I wish you were here.
       G                    C
Lying by my side, holding me near,
           G                              D
listening to the rain,        and the passing cars,
         C            D          G
and the waves on________English     Bay
