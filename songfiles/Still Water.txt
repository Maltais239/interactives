Still Water
Daniel Lanois
Key: F

Sad eyes, sad eyes
Where're you going with that confidence?
Sad eyes, sad eyes
Where're you going with that confidence?

I'm going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide
I'm going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide

Still water - Laying over
Still water - Laying over
Still water - Laying over
Caledonia river oh, so wide

Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?

I'm going to build the bridges high
for working money, for working money
I'm going to climb the bridges high
Caledonia brother far away

Still water - I'm laying over
Still water - Lay my body down over
Still water - Laying over
Caledonia river far away...

Sad eyes in the weary night
Have you seen your brother,
have you seen your brother?
Waiting by the river Grand
Caledonia river oh, so wide

Going to where the rain falls
Look for my brother,
look for my brother
Going to where the rain falls
Caledonia river far away

Still water - Laying over
Still water - Lay my body down
Still water - Laying over
Caledonia river far away...
