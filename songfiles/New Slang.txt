Verse 1
Am               C              F
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
C              G
Were all in my mouth
     C            F            Am   G
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Am             C      F
Turn me back into the pet
  C           G
I was when we met
      C       F            Am   G
I was happier then with no mind set

Chorus
             G       C
And if you'd took to me like
 F     C            G
A gull takes to the wind
          G           C
Well, I'd jumped from my trees
     F       C               F           C
And I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores
        F           C              G
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

Verse 2
Am                 C          F
New slang when you notice the stripes
    C            G
The dirt in your fries
          C              F
Hope it's right when you die
        Am   G
Old and bo...ny
Am                 C                F
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
C               G
Never should've called
    C                F
But my head's to the wall
        Am  G
And I'm lonely

Chorus
             G       C
And if you'd took to me like
 F     C            G
A gull takes to the wind
          G           C
Well, I'd jumped from my trees
     F       C               F           C
And I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores
        F           C              G
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

Verse 3
Am               C          F
Godspeed all the baker's at dawn
         C             G
May they all cut their thumbs
          C          F
And bleed into their buns
           Am    G
'Till they melt away

Chorus 2
            G         C
I'm looking in on the good life
          F       C        G
I might be doomed never to find
          G               C
Without a trust or flaming fields
     F   C       G
Am I too dumb to refine?
                       C
And if you'd took to me like
     F     C               F            C
Well I'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores
F                   C             G
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
