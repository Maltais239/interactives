Hey good lookin' why the frown?
     A                                    E
you always look better when it's upside down
             A                         D
you say you got nowhere, that your goin to

I took the Dartmouth ferry into the town
         A                    E
spend my pennies bummin' around
 A                                              D
tryin' to find a way to tear a strip off these blues
 A       E            A
Can I go nowhere with you?

    A                        E
Paid the cover, saw the show
  A                                   E
sat at the bar where the drinks did flow
  A                                 D
didn't see a single face that i knew,
  A           E             A
'till i went nowhere with you.

   D                           A
Can I tag along tonight? we'll kill some time
                    E      D
it looks like you might, need a little company
       A                           E
I'm so cheap, I might as well be free.
