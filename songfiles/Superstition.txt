Superstition
Stevie Wonder
Key: Eb
Tempo: 96 BPM



           Eb7
Very super-stitious, writing's on the  wall,
           Eb7
Very super-stitious ladders bout' to fall,
                   Eb7
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
               Eb7
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

Chorus 1:

            Bb9      B9-5            Bb9         A9-5
When you be-lieve in things that you don't under-stand,
         Ab7      Bb7                       Eb7
Then you suffer,     Superstition ain't the way

Verse 2:

           Eb7
Very super-stitious, wash your face and hands ,
              Eb7
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can,
             Eb7
Keep me in a daydream keep me goin' strong,
                Eb7
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song.

Chorus 2:

            Bb9      B9-5            Bb9         A9-5
When you be-lieve in things that you don't under-stand,
         Ab7      Bb7                       Eb7
Then you suffer,     Superstition ain't the way

Very super-stitious, nothin' more to say,

                   Eb7
