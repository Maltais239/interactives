Well I guess it would be nice
if I could touch your body
           E
I know not everybody
                    B
has got a body like you.


But I've got to think twice

before I give my heart away
           E
And I know all the games you play
                      B
because I played them too.

         E                       B
Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
E                                     B
Time to pick my heart up off the floor.
             E                    B      G#7
Oh when that love comes down with-out de-votion
        C#                              F#
Well it takes a strong man baby but I'm showing you the door.

                         B
Because I've got to have faith
I've got to have faith
Because I've got to have faith faith faith
I've got to have faith faith faith.

  B
Baby I know you're asking me to stay
                   E
Stay please please please don't go away.
                           B
You say I'm giving you the blues.


Maybe you mean every word you say
               E
Can't help but think of yesterday
                B
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules.


   E                  B
Be-fore this river be-comes an ocean
   E                                       B
Be-fore you throw my heart back on the floor
          E             B       G#7
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
       C#                               F#
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more.

                     B
Yes I've got to have faith
I've got to have faith
Yes I've got to have faith faith faith
I've got to have faith faith faith
