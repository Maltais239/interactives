Verse 1
G     D               Am7
Drove downtown in the rain, 9night
        D                        Bm7    Am7
Just to check out the late night record shop
G         D                   Am7
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane
G               D                    Bm7  Am7 G
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stah-op
                 D                             Am7                          G
It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning, a matter of fact
         D               Bm7  Am7  G
You can call me Pavlov's dog
        D                    Am7                         G
Ring a bell and I'll salivate, well how'd you like that
      D                   Bm7           Am7
Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue, 'cause right now I'm


Chorus
G        D             Am7
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
         G         D                   Em         Em/C    Em/C#    Em/C  G
Well I'm, lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did


Verse 2
           D       Am7                            G
Well I'm lying here, just staring at the ceiling tiles
           D          Bm7                  Am7   G
And I'm thinking about, whoa what to think about
      D             Am7                   G
Just listening and relistening to smiley smile
           D                 Bm7             Am7
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought, because I'm

Bridge
Am7              D              F            Em
And if you wanna find me I'll be out in the sandbox
Am7            D                      G        F      Am7
Just wondering where the hell all the love has gah-ah-ahn
              D                F              Em             Am7
Playing my guitar and building castles in the sun, whoa-whoa-oh-oh
    D                 G
And singing fun, fun, fun

Bridge
  Em7   Am               Em7           Am
I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
    Em7                Am      Em7                            Am
And though I was very heavy I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
  Em7             Am               Em7
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
Am                Em7
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am                Em7
Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
Am                E7
Somebody help meeeeee, because I'm
