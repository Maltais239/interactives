Verse
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
G             F              G
and I've been working like a dog.
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
G           F               G
I should be sleeping like a log.
           C
But when I get home to you
           D
I find the things that you do
             G    C    G
Will make me feel alright.

Verse
G               C   G
You know I work all day
G          F                G
To get you money to buy you things
G                         C        G
And it's worth it just to hear you say
G            F            G
You're gonna give me everything
           C
So why on earth should I moan
              D
'cause when I get you alone
D             G    C G
you know I'll feel O.K.

Everything seems to be alright

When I'm home
Em                     C      D
Feeling you holding me tight, tight yeah!!
