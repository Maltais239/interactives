I really can't stay
                    But baby it's cold outside
     Am        D7          Am     D7
I've got to go away
             But baby it's cold outside
     G          Gmaj7         G
The evening has been
             Been hoping that you'd drop in
        Dm7                 G7
So very nice
             I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice


Chorus
   C
My mother will start worry
                    Beautiful what’s your hurry?
     Cm
And father will be pacing the floor
                                   Listen to the fireplace roar
    G
So really i'd better scurry
                   Beautiful please don't hurry
     Am                       D
But maybe just a half a drink more
                              Put some records on while I pour

Verse 2
    G                Gmaj7    G        Gmaj7
The neighbors might think
                    Baby it's bad out there
      Am             D7          Am      D7
Say, what's in this drink?
                   No cabs to be had out there
   G           Gmaj7             G
I wish i knew how
              Your eyes are like starlight now
             Dm7              G7
To break the spell
               I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

Chorus
   C
I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"
                           Mind if I move in closer?
   Cm                          D7
At least i'm gonna say that i tried
                              What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?
    G          F7          E7
I really can't stay
               Baby don't hold out
             A7    D7  G
Ah, but it's cold outside

Verse 3
  G           Gmaj7      G  Gmaj7
I simply must go
             Baby, it's cold outside
    Am        D7               Am  D7
The answer is no
             Ooh darling, it's cold outside
G  Gmaj7  G  G
This welcome has been
               I'm lucky that you dropped in
            Dm7              G7
So nice and warm
                Look out the window at that storm

Chorus
   C
My sister will be suspicious
                   Man, your lips look delicious
   Cm
My brother will be there at the door
                               Waves upon a tropical shore
   G
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
                         Gosh your lips are delicious
     Am                        D
Well maybe just a half a drink more
                               Never such a blizzard before

Verse 4
     G         Gmaj7            G          Gmaj7
I've got to go home
               Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
      Am          D7         Am        D7
Say, lend me your coat
             It's up to your knees out there
       G           Gmaj7          G
You've really been grand
                I thrill when you touch my hand
              Dm7         G7
But don't you see?
              How can you do this thing to me?

Chorus
        C
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
                        Think of my life long sorrow
   Cm                          D7
At least there will be plenty implied
                               If you caught pneumonia and died
   G           F7           E7
I really can't stay
              Get over that hold out
              A7   D7  G
Ahh, but it's cold outside
