Cold Winter Song
Jay Sparrow
Key: Bb

Bb
Oh my day is fading long
                    Eb
In this cold winter song
                      Bb
And I’ve loved you so long
                       F
And I’ve taken you for granted
                       Bb
But you took it on the chin

Bb
Oh my cold winter song
                 Eb
Forsaken all the rest
                       Bb
Cause your love is the best
                 F
What took you so long
                    Bb
The winter kept you gone

Eb                       Bb
Now I can only count the days
                     Eb
I can only count the days
                         Bb
Now I can only count the days
                     F
I can only count the days
                                                    Bb for 8
So pull down the shades honey, till the winter goes  away

Bb
Now it's my dead winter song
                       Eb
It was with you in the sun
                            Gm
While your cold chains were gone
                       F
And I’ve missed you so long
                                Bb
But you only came for this song here…

Oh my day is fading long
In this cold winter song
And I’ve loved you so long

Eb                   Bb
I can only count the days
                     Eb
I can only count the days
                     Gm
I can only count the days
                     Eb
I can only count the days
Eb                   Bb
I can only count the days
                     F
I can only count the days

                                                    Bb
So pull down the shades honey, till the winter goes away
