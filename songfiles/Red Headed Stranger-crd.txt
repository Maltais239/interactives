Red Headed Stranger-crd
Willie Nelson
Key: D



    D
The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
                   A
Rode into town one day
    D                     G            D
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
    E7                   A
And walkin' behind was a bay
    D
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
                           A
And lips that were sad and tight
    D                      G
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
        A                  D
And his heart was heavy as night

Chorus:
         G
So don't cross him, don't boss him
     D
He's wild in his sorrow
                                A
He's ridin' and he's hidin' his pain
      G
Don't fight him, don't spite him
     D
Just wait 'til tomorrow
A                     D
Maybe he'll ride on again
A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
And she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that the dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife
Chorus
The yellow-haired lady went down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink, and he gave her some money
But he just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
Chorus
The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman
Who's tryin' to steal your horse
Now this is the tale of the red-headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay
Chorus
