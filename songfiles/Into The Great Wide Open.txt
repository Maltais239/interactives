 Eddie waited till he finished high school
Em                    Em7    A7
He went to Hollywood,  got a tattoo
Am                      Am7           C
He met a girl out there with a tattoo too
    G      F        C
The future was wide open

They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a nightclub he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

G         C           D
 Into the  great wide  open,
G           C         D     Am
 Under them  skies of  blue
G           C           D
 Out in the  great wide  open,
  G      F          Em    A
A  rebel  without a  clue

The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
T he sky was the limit

His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said "I don't hear a single"
The future was wide open

Into the great wide open,
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open,
A rebel without a clue

Into the great wide open,
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open,
A rebel without a clue
