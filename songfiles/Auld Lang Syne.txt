Auld Lang Syne
Words by Robert Burns
Key: G

Best song to ever ring in the New Year. This may not be completely correct, but
it sounds pretty good to my ears. Happy holidays, and enjoy!

Verse 1
        G                D
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
    Em               C
And never brought to mind?
       G                 D
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
    Em   C    G
And auld lang syne!

Chorus
    G         D
For auld lang syne, my dear,
    G         C
For auld lang syne.
      G             D
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
    Em   C    G
For auld lang syne.

Verse 2
      G                D
And surely you’ll buy your pint cup!
     Em              C
And surely I’ll buy mine!
           G             D
And we'll take a cup o’ kindness yet,
     Em  C    G
for auld lang syne.

Chorus

For auld lang syne, my dear,

For auld lang syne.

We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,

For auld lang syne.

Verse 3
   G              D
We two have run about the slopes,
     Em                 C
And picked the daisies fine;
           G              D
But we’ve wandered many a weary foot,
      Em   C    G
Since auld lang syne.

Chorus
    G         D
For auld lang syne, my dear,
    G         C
For auld lang syne.

We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
    Em   C    G
For auld lang syne.

Verse 4
   G                D
We two have paddled in the stream,
      Em               C
From morning sun till dine;
      G              D
But seas between us broad have roared
      Em   C    G
Since auld lang syne.

Chorus
    G         D
For auld lang syne, my dear,
    G         C
For auld lang syne.
      G             D
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
    Em   C    G
For auld lang syne.

Verse 5
     G                D
And there’s a hand my trusty friend!
    Em                 C
And give me a hand o’ thine!
    G                  D
And we’ll take a right good-will draught,
      Em  C    G
For auld lang syne.

Chorus
    G         D
For auld lang syne, my dear,
    G         C
For auld lang syne.
      G             D
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
    Em   C    G
For auld lang syne.
