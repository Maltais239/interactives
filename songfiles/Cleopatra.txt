Verse
G
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
                                                D
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
          G
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
                                     D
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

Pre-chorus
G                                  C              G
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
                                                D
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
      G                           C                G
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
                                                      D
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

Chorus
          G        D     C        G     C            G          D
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           G   D             C   G             C        G     D
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

Pre-chorus II
          G                       C                       G
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
                                             D
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
     G                     C       G
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
         C               G                        D
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

Chorus
          G        D     C        G     C            G          D
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           G   D             C   G             C        G     D
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

Bridge
        Em                 G           C     D     Em
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
         G                        Em            C        D      G
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

Pre-chorus II
      G                C               G
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
                                              D
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
      G                    C                   G
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
       C         G
           stop
It's a bed and a bathroom
                    D
And a place for the end

Chorus
            G       D     C        G     C            G          D
I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           G   D             C   G             C        G     D
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

End
D G
