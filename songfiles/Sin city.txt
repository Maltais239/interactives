         D                   A
This old town is filled with sin
        D7           G
It will swallow you in
   D                        A   A7
If you've got some money to burn
        D          A
Take it home right away
A          D7             G
You've got three years to pay
    D       A7           D   D7
But Satan is waiting his turn
         G                  A7              D       D7
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
   G               D            A
It seems like this whole town's insane
       G            A7      D    D7     G
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
      D            A7             D     A
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
    D          A
The scientists say
        D7       G
It will all wash away
    D                    A  A7
But we don't believe any more
            D       A
Cause we've got our recruits
        D7            G
And our green mohair suits
   D                A7          D      D7
So please show your I.D. At the door
         G                  A7              D          D7
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
   G               D             A7
It seems like this whole town's insane
       G            A7      D    D7     G
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
      D            A7             D     A
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain


SOLO

  D           A
A friend came around
         D7            G
Tried to clean up this town
    D                      A   A7
His ideas made some people mad
       D           A
But he trusted his crowd
      D7              G
So he spoke right out loud
    D                  A7          D  D7
And they lost the best friend they had
         G                  A7              D       D7
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
   G               D            A7
It seems like this whole town's insane
       G            A7      D    D7     G
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
      D            A7             D   D7
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
       G            A7      D    D7     G
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
      D            A7             G   D
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
