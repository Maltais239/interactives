I Am Trying To Break Your Heart Acoustic
Wilco
Key: A



A                 Em        D
 I am an American  aquarium  drinker
A                    Em      D
 I assassin down the  avenue
A                      Em        D
 I'm hiding out in the  big city  blinking
A                           Em         D
 What was I thinking when I  let go of  you

AEm  D
  x 2

Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt

AEm  D
  x 2

I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take it from the inside, baby, hold on tight
You were so right when you said I'd been drinking
What was I thinking when we said goodnight

Riff 1 x 2
Riff 2 x 2

I want to hold you in the bible-black pre-dawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello

Riff 2 x 2

I always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in

(palm mute during this next verse in a steady rhythm)

I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
And still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart

AEm  D
  x 4

Disposable dixie cup drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you


Riff 1:








Riff 2:








You have to listen to the recording to figure out Riff 2's strumming pattern, and I know
I'm missing some notes, but it still sounds pretty close.  Also, he strums the A and D
in a steady rhythm like in the verses between chord changes during the riff.

Enjoy!
