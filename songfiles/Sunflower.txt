Needless to say, I keep it in check

Chorus
D
 Then you're left in the dust unless I stuck by ya

Wish I could be there for ya, give me a reason to go

Every time I'm walkin' out, I can hear you tellin' me to turn around

Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down

Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh
