A Poem on the Underground Wall
one guitar, low vocal
Tempo: 96 BPM

The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
Hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a coloured crayon

Now from the tunnels stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide the welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws deeper in the shadows
And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket, quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertizing
A single-worded poem comprised of four letters
And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks bounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night
