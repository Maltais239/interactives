     G
If I find my little hideaway
     Am   Am/F#         G
If I find my little hideaway
  Am   C7         G
I know I'm gonna stay

     G
Your eyes of blue and grey
     Am   Am/F#       G
Your eyes of blue and grey
            Am
Have got me saying all those things I
C7                    G
Never thought I would say

        G
Did you think youd be in this place
        Am    Am/F#             G
Did you think you'd be in this place
        Am
Did you smile all the while
       C7                               G
At the thought that we'd cross in this way

  G
I forgot what it was like out this way
  Am     Am/F#                     G
I forgot what it was like out this way
    Am                    C7
The skies and the seas of green
On which we'd sail away
