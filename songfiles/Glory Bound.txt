Verse:
Em      G        D        Cadd9
Freedom came my way that night
Em      G         D         Cadd9
Just like a jet plane in and out of sight
Em    G          D               Cadd9
Oh I was haulin ass at a million miles an hour
Em        G          D Cadd9
Wonderin how hard I hit
Em             G          D    Cadd9
When they came in to the station
Em        G           D        Cadd9
They said I was bad beyond repair
Em             G         D      Cadd9
But I got no qualms with my situation
Em   G     D
Say here I am
    Em   G           D              Cadd9
So say Cheri Cheri Cheri won't you dare to
Em    G           D              Cadd9
Say Cheri Cheri Cheri won't you dare to
 Am              C                G   Gsus2
Leave a message and your number please
 Am        C            G     Gsus2
Tie em up all my old fantasies
 Am                  C             D           Dsus4
Put em in a big red bow and send them care of me

Chorus:
 G            Cadd9       D   Dsus4
I'm taking a chance on the wind
 G             Cadd9     DDsus4
I'm packing up all my bags
 G         Cadd9     D       Dsus4
Taking a mistake I gotta make
 G        Cadd9   D Cadd9
Them I'm glory bound

Verse:
So I packed it up and I went to the winds
And I lived out of VW Bus for a year or two
Ain't nothin but a pipe dream and my guitar
Livin off of apple fields and old cigars
Diggin this microphone, checkin it out every night on a loan
Oh the car battery's dead again so I got my head dead set against it
Sing say Cheri Cheri Cheri won't you dare to
Say Cheri Cheri Cheri won't you dare to
Leave a message and your number please
Take the time to want to satisfy me
Take all my old fantasies and send them care of me
