Ooh La La
The Faces
Key: G
Capo 7

Sounds better than first fret capo in my opinion.


Verse 1

 G                 Am7
Poor old Granddad  I laughed at all his words
 G                              Am7
I thought he was a bitter man   He spoke of women's ways
 G                                   Am7
They'll trap you, then they use you  Be-fore you even know
 G                                          Am7
For love is blind and you're far too kind   Don't ever let it show


Chorus

 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was younger
 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was stronger.


Verse 2

 G                                 Am7
The Can Can's such a pretty show   They'll steal your heart away
 G                                   Am7
But backstage, back on earth again   The dressing rooms are grey
 G                                          Am7
They come on strong and it ain't too long   Before they make you feel a man
 G                                         Am7
But love is blind and you soon will find   You're just a boy again


Chorus

 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was younger
 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was stronger.

Verse 3

 G                                        Am7
When you want her lips, you get a cheek   Makes you wonder where you are
 G                                            Am7
If you want some more and she's fast asleep   Leaves you twinkling with the stars.
 G                           Am7
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
 G                                  Am7
You'll have to learn, just like me  And that's the hardest way
       G
Ooh la la
       Am7        C
Ooh la la, la la, yeah


Chorus

 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was younger
 G                             Am7   C
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was stronger.
