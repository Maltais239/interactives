Verse


G
 Nice to meet you

 Where you been?
                               Em
 I could show you incredible things

 Magic, madness, heaven, sin
                             C/G
 Saw you there and I thought oh my god

 Look at that face, you look like my next mistake
  D/A
 Love's a game, want to play?


Verse


G
 New money, suit and tie
                            Em
 I can read you like a magazine

 Ain't it funny, rumors fly
                            C/G
 And I know you heard about me

 So hey, let's be friends

 I'm dying to see how this one ends
   D/A
 Grab your passport and my hand

 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


Chorus


G
 So it's gonna be forever
                            
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
Em
 You can tell me when it's over

 If the high was worth the pain
C
 Got a long list of ex lovers

 They'll tell you I'm insane
D
 Cause you know I love the players

 And you love the game
G
 So godamn reckless
                         G/F#
 We'll take this way too far
Em
 It'll leave you breathless

 Or with a nasty scar
C
 Got a long list of ex lovers

 They'll tell you I'm insane
D
 But I got a blank space baby
                      G
 And I'll write your name


Verse


G
 Cherry lips

 Crystal skies
                       G/F#      Em
 I could show you incredible things

 Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                              C/G
 I’m your king, and you’re my queen

 Find out what you want

 Be that girl for a month
   D/A
 Wait, the worst is yet to come


Verse


G
 Screaming, crying, perfect storms
                            Em
 I can make all the tables turn

 Rose garden filled with thorns
                               C/G
 Keep you second guessing like oh my god

 Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy
      D/A
 But you'll come back each time you leave

 
Chorus


G
 So it's gonna be forever
                            
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
