I wonder

I wonder at the morning with red blurry eyes
and sometimes at the distance between you and I
I wonder at the many things we seem to deny
But if you think you know what’s coming well you’re in for a surprise

I wonder

I wonder at the talking heads all in a line
And how they turn a simple truth into a lie
and sometimes at your beauty even they can’t deny
And how I blinked and somehow years slipped by

I wonder

I wonder at the oldest and at the newest things
and at all the turns that each day brings
I wonder at the branches that make up a life
also at the ones that withered and died

I wonder

I wonder at the stars that wander the sky
at often the way you seem to stick in my mind
I wonder at the things that we left behind
Do we get them back or do we kiss them goodbye
I wonder at your lips and your hips and your eyes
I wonder at the sound of your voice in the night
I wonder if you’ll stay and I’m hoping you might
and how long has it been since we watched the sun rise
