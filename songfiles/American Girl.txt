D               E
Well she was an American girl
G         A
Raised on promises
D                 E
She couldn't help thinking that there was
  G                   A
A little more to life somewhere else
                   D
After all it was a great big world
G                      Em
With lots of places to run to
A
Yes and if she had to die trying she'd
that's one real promise she was gonna keep

G        A
Oh yeah, allright
D                  Bm
Take it easy baby, make it last all night
G        A           D
She was, an American girl

D                 E
Well it was kinda cold that night
G                      A
She stood alone on her balcony
D                  E
She could hear the cars roll by
       G        A
Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach
                      D
And for one desperate moment there
G                    Em
He crept back in her memory
A
God it's so painful when something is so close
But still so hard to reach

G        A
Oh yeah, allright
D                  Bm
Take it easy baby, make it last all night
G        A           D
She was, an American girl
