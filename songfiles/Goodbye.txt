Goodbye
Steve Earle
Key: C



C                  G/B
I remember holdin' on to you
Am                F               C
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
C                             G/B
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
      F              G G7            C
But I can't remember if we said goodbye


Bridge:
      F                                     C
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
                G            G7
One place I may never go
G7           C       G G7
In my life again

      C                           G/B
Was I just off somewhere just too high
     F              G               C
But I can't remember if we said goodbye


I only miss you every now and then
Like a soft breeze blowin up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

Repeat bridge

Coda:
      F              G               Am
But I can't remember if we said goodbye
F
Goodbye
C
Goodbye

Note  (G7) means maybe throw in a dominant seventh
the C and G chords use sus 4's etc off and on.

You can incorporate the riff that runs throughout the song into
your fingerpicking by playing it on the 4th (D) and 5th (A)
strings, effectively playing Csus4's, G6/B's, G7/B's etc.

Csus4=x33010
G/B  =x20003
G6/B =x22003
G7/B =x23003

use a C harp for the harmonica solo

Cheers,
