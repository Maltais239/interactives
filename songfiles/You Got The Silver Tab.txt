You Got The Silver Tab
You Got The Silver - Rolling Stones
From the album 'Let It Bleed'
Written by M. Jagger and K. Richard

This is a transcription of the main acoustic guitar part. I wrote this because
the current version at `OLGA` - mistakenly called `You Got The Sliver` is far
from accurate and contains chords of which I, and probably the Stones also, have
never heard of.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
