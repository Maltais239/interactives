forever
Ben Harper
Key: Am

                                    FOREVER
(Ben Harper)
from the album 'Welcome to the Cruel World'
The song is basically fingerpicked variations on these chords: F, Am, G, C

Intro:
Am     F     G        Am              C     F     G
                                                  





Verse:
C     F      G        Am
                      





Not talkin' bout a year........

Chorus:
C     G      Am       G
                      





So give me your, forever..
Verse:(C,F,G,Am)
Not talkin' bout a year, no not three or four
I don't want that kind of forever in my life anymore
Forever always seems to be around when it begins
But forever never seems to be around when it ends
Chorus:(C,G,Am,G)
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not another day less will do
>From you
People spend so much time every single day
Runnin' round all over town giving their forever way
But no not me I won't let my forever roam
And now i hope i can find my forever a home
Chorus
Like a handless clock with numbers an infinite of time
No not the forever found only in the mind
Forever always seems to be around when things begin
But forever always seems to be around when things end
Chorus

Kudos to all of you who know of and appreciate this artist's music.
This is a good one off the Welcome to the Cruel World album.  It is
played slowly and in standard tuning.  If you listen to the song, you
will notice he plays will slaps/mutes (whatever you call it), which I
didn't write in, but occur in the obvious places.

This is close enough.  There are slight variations throughout the song,
but stays the same for the most part.  Didn't have time for the lyrics,
but I think they're in the album cover.  Enjoy.
