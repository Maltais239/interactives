Lost In The Light
The key riff repeated in this song is a hammer-on with the middle and ring fingers, which brings you from
Key: A
the A chord shape into the D chord. Pluck those D-G-B strings with your fingers and get that low D
string ringing with your thumb, and you'll be golden.

Verse 1
A D
  I'm lost in the light
A D
  I pray for the night
A D           A          G
  To take me, to take you too

A D                D
  After so many words
A D                 D
  Still nothing's heard
A D           A            G
  Don't know what we should do
      Bm            A      G               A D
So if someone could see me now, let them see you

A D
  'twas my greatest thrill
A D
  When we just stood still
A D             A                           G
  You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill

A D
  Even countin' sheep
A D
  Don't help me sleep
A D                A                      G
  I just toss and turn right there beside you
      Bm            A       G                  A D
So if someone could help me now, they'd help you too

AD
 

Chorus
                G
They'd help you too
         A
See you through
        Em          D         G
All the hard things we've all gotta do
                   G
Cause this life is long
                       Em
And so you wouldn't be wrong
       D                    G
Being free, leaving me on my own

Verse 2
A D
  And I held my own
A D
  Still I rattled your bones
A D                    A                     G
  I said some awful things and I take them back
A D
  If we would try again
A D
  Just remember when
A D                 A                     G
  Before we were lovers, I swear we were friends
       Bm           A      G              A D
So if someone could see me now let them see you

Chorus

Let them see you
         A
See you through
         Em         D          G
All the hard things we've all gotta do
                    G
'Cause this life is long
                   Em
So you wouldn't be wrong
      D                       G
Being free leaving with me on my own
