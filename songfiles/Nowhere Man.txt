Nowhere Man
Beatles
Key: G



To play this as it sounds on the record, put a capo on
the second fret.

(So when I write D I mean play a D shape at the capo i.e
two frets higher than it normally is)


Intro :



He's a real nowhere man

Sitting in his nowhere land

G              Gm                D
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
D              A
Doesn't have a point of view
G                    D
Knows not where he's going to
G            Gm             D
Isn't he a bit like you and me
        F#m        G
Nowhere man please listen
            F#m            G
You don't know what you're missing
        F#m     Em7                     A7
Nowhere man the world is at your command

Solo:
-----
      Same chords as for verse

Verse 2:

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all
Nowhere man don't worry
Take your time don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

There are a couple more repeats, but the chords are
the same
