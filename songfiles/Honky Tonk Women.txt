Verse 1
  G                                    C
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
    G                A               D
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
    G                                  C
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
         G                  D                 G
‘cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

Chorus
         G     D          G
It's the ho-oooo-nky tonk women
     G             D                    G
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky-tonk blues

  G                            C
I laid a divorcee in New York City
  G              A              D
I had to put up some kind of a fight
    G                            C
The lady then she covered me in roses
    G                D                 G
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky-tonk blues
