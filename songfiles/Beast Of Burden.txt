G          Em7     Em7aug5       D4
I'll never be your beast      of burden
   G       Em7       Em7aug5     D4
My back is broad but it's a      hurting
G     Em7         Em7aug5     D4      G Em7Em7aug5D4
All I want is for you to make love to me
G          Em7     Em7aug5         D4
I'll never be your beast        of burden
G               Em7   Em7aug5     D4
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting
G     Em7         Em7aug5     D4      G Em7Em7aug5D4
All I want is for you to make love to me

     C                 G
Am I hard enough, Am I rough enough
     C                G                D
Am I rich enough, I'm not too blind to see

I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Music on the radio
Come on baby make sweet love to me

     C                 G
Am I hard enough, Am I rough enough
     C                G                D
Am I rich enough, I'm not too blind to see
Oh little sister

G     Em7             Em7aug5         D4
      Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, girl
         G               Em7             Em7aug5        D4
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
G
Pretty, pretty
Em7            Em7aug5        D4
Such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
G       Em7  Em7aug5         D4
Come on baby please, please, please

I'll tell ya
        G         Em7
You can put me out
Em7aug5       D4
On the        street
G         Em7
Put me out
      Em7aug5       D4
With no shoes on my feet
     G           Em7
But, put me out, put me out
Em7aug5       D4
Put me out of misery

      G        Em7
Yeah, all your sickness
      Em7aug5   D4
I can suck it up
G               Em7
Throw it all at me
      Em7aug5     D4
I can shrug it    off
G                 Em7
There's one thing baby
     Em7aug5      D4
That I don't understand
G           Em7
You keep on telling me
  Em7aug5            D4
I ain't your kind of man

        C                               G
Ain't I rough enough, ooh baby, Ain't I tough enough
        C            G                         D
Ain't I rich enough, in love enough, Ooh! Ooh! Please

I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be

I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles and my feet are hurting
All I want is you to make love to me

I don't need beast of burden
I need no fussing
I need no nursing
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be
