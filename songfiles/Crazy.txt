Cm                                                      Ebmaj7
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             Ab
There was something so pleasant about that place.

Even your emotions had an echo
               Gsus4   G
In so much space
Cm
And when you're out there, without care,
                     Ebmaj7
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                       Ab
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                       Gsus4  G
I just knew too much


Chorus

                  Cm
Does that make me crazy?
                  Eb
Does that make me crazy??
                  Ab
Does that make me crazy???
                  Gsus4     G
Possibly.


Verse 2

C                                                Ab
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            Ebmaj7                   Gsus4   G
But think twice, that's my only advice
Cm                                                                     Eb
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      Ab
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                             Gsus4       G
You really think you're in control


Chorus

                  Cm
Well, I think you're crazy!
                  Ebmaj7
I think you're crazy!
                  Ab
I think you're crazy,
                  Gsus4     G
Just like me.


Verse 3

C                                                Ab
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
            Ebmaj7                   Gsus4   G
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Cm                                                                     Eb
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                      Ab
And it's no coincidence I've come
                             Gsus4       G
And I can die when I'm done


Chorus

          Cm
Maybe I'm crazy
             Ebmaj7
Maybe you're crazy
            Ab
Maybe we're crazy
            Gsus4     G
Probably
