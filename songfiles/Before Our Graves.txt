Before Our Graves

Key: C

C                       F               C
                                        

F
I need peace tonight
C
She don’t really mind
F
She’s got something there,
G
I can’t leave behind.

F
All those winter walks,
C
Tried to keep you warm.
F
And all those midnight talks,
G
We need to face the storm

Give us,

C                        F
One more before our graves
F                        C
Don’t last like all those days
C                                G
One last trip, one last sip, one last breath one day.
C                        F
When summer’s in our hearts
F                        C
And winter’s in our eyes.
C
No sweeping stones, no walking home,
G                        C
One more before our graves

F
And all those broken dreams
C
We kept heading west
F
And all those frayed seams
G
That time tailors to test

F
And all those summer nights
C
Raise a cup til dawn
F
Watch those rising lights
G
There’s time for one last song.

Give us,

C                        F
One more before our graves
F                        C
Don’t last like all those days
C                                G
One last trip, one last sip, one last breath one day.
C                        F
When summer’s in our hearts
F                        C
And winter’s in our eyes.
C
No sweeping stones, no walking home,
G
One more before our graves

F
I don’t want to live forever
Em
I just want to leave together
Dm                                C
She knows in her heart’s my home

F
But we don’t know how long the road is
Em
We just keep on rolling there until
Dm                                G
We reach that end alone

Give us,

C                        F
One more before our graves
F                        C
Don’t last like all those days
C                                G
One last trip, one last sip, one last breath one day.
C                        F
When summer’s in our hearts
F                        C
And winter’s in our eyes.
C
No sweeping stones, no walking home,
G                        C
One more before our graves
