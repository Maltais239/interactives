D       A        D                G
I don't get many things right the first time
   D            Bm          C  C
In fact, I am told that a lot
      A            A/C#
Now I know all the wrong turns,
    D            G                D
The stumbles and falls brought me here
Bm       F#m  A
              
Bm            G            Bm
And where was I before the day
             E               A
That I first saw your lovely face
      F#m          G  G
Now I see it every day
    D      A
And I     know
     D     A
That I     am
Bm F#m
I  am
G D A       D      A
I am the luckiest

        D        A
What if I'd been born
D                  G
Fifty years before you
      D
In a house
           Bm           C     C
On the street where you lived
      A      A/C#
Maybe I'd be outside
           D          G
As you passed on your bike
        D              Bm      F#m     A
Would I know?
Bm       G           Bm
And in a wide sea of eyes
      E             A      F#m  G
I see one pair that I recognize

    D A
And I know
     D A
That I am
Bm F#m
I  am
G D A       D             A
I am the luckiest

Em                          Bm
I love you more than I have
                    D       G      A
Ever found a way to say to you

        D
Next door
           A
There's an old man
       D               G
Who lived to his nineties
        D           Bm          C
And one day, passed away in his sleep
        A        A/C#
And his wife she stayed
          D     G               D      Bm  F#m  A
For a couple of days and passed away

Bm         G
I'm sorry, I know that's a
Bm             E               A
Strange way to tell you that I know
       F#m G
We belong
     D   A
That I know

     D A
That I am
BmF#m
I am
G D A        Bm   F#m
I amthe luckiest
G       D     A     D
