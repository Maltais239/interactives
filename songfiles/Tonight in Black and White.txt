Tonight in Black and White
Jeff McLellan
Key: D
Capo 4

D
The summer’s half over.
Still waiting for the rain to end.
A
There’s another soft shoulder who
G
doesn’t want me to hold her.

D
No good morning Maggie.
She’s unwilling with whisky or wine.
A
No vitriol on Valentines
G
Let the sun set red and take these eyes and make them blind.

G            A            D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight in black and white.
G            A            D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight.
G            A            D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight.

D
It’s autumn at midnight.
Winter’s breathing down my door.
A
The night’s are getting colder, but
G
she doesn’t want me to hold her.

D
I’m feeding the embers,
with letters and pictures and lies.
A
The troubadours poeticize.
G                    D
These love songs are cheap unwanted long goodbyes.


G            A        D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight in black and white.
G            A        D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight.
G            A        D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight in black and white.
G            A        D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight.

G    A        D
But all things must pass
G    A        D
You better make them good while they last.
Bm            G        D
Cause I’m not alone, I’m not alone, no one wants to be alone.

G    A        D
Slipping out of my grasp
G    A        D
As time ticks into the past.
Bm            G        D
Cause I’m not alone, I’m not alone, no one wants to be alone.

D
The sunrise on cedars.
No woman weighing on my heart.

G            A        D
Let the moonlight that girl tonight in black and white.
