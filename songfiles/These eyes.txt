Guess Who
Key: Dm



      Dm7            Cmaj7      C
These eyes cry every night for you
      Dm7          Cmaj7      C  C/B
These arms long to hold you again

Chorus 1:
Am              C
The hurtin's on me
Am              C
I will never be free
Am                    C
You gave a promise to me
         G
And you broke it

Verse 2:
These eyes watched you bring my world to an end
This heart could not accept and pretend

Chorus 1:
The hurtin's on me
I will never be free
You took a vow with me
When you spoke it

Bridge:
Fmaj7/G  Cmaj7
               These eyes
Fmaj7/G  Cmaj7
               are cryin'
Fmaj7/G         Cmaj7
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
            Fmaj7/G                 Cmaj7               D
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
