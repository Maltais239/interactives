G                               C     G
Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
G              D7      G
And welcome me back to town
G                              C              G
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
         A7                       D7
And I'll tell you how it all went down
G                             G7                      C
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
      G              G7            C
And a good saloon in every single town
    C          D7                      G
And I remember something that you once told me
    C                 D7              G
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
C               D            G     Bm/F# Em
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
    C                D                     G
And they all lead me straight back home to you
        Bm             C       D7        G
Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Em                    D7                  G
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
      Bm                  C      D7        G
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
      C                      D7          C           D    G
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennesee
G                            C     G
We flew straight across that river bridge
           D7        G
Last night half past two
G                               C                G      A7
The switchman waved his lantern goodbye and good day as we
             D7
Went rolling through
G                         G7                   C
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel
G                     D7             G
And now   I know just what I have to do
        Bm               C           D  G
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
            Em                D                         G
He wants to take my money for something I've never been shown
      Bm                  C      D         G
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
      C                      D           C           D    G
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennesee
G                            C           G
The news I could bring I met up with the king
               D7          G
On his head an amphetamine crown
                                    C     G
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
    A7                         D7
And headed out for some desert town
G                             G7                      C
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
      G                           C
And a good saloon in every single town
    C          D                       G
And I remember something that you once told me
    C                 D               G
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
C               D            G     Bm/F# Em
Twenty thousand roads I went down  down  down
    C                D                     G
And they all lead me straight back home to you
C               D            G     Bm/F# Em
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
    C                D                     G
And they all lead me straight back home to you
