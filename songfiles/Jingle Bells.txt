Jingle Bells
James Pierpont, now public domain
Key: C

C
Dashing through the snow
                      F
In a one horse open sleigh
                   G
O'er the fields we go
                  C
Laughing all the way
C
Bells on bob tails ring
                 F
Making spirits bright
F                   G
What fun it is to laugh and sing
G                   C
A sleighing song tonight

C
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
F               C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
G
In a one horse open sleigh
C
Jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
F                      C
Oh, what fun it is to ride
G              (F)     C
In a one horse open sleigh


(lesser-known verses follow with the same chord structure)


A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead
