G
Well, I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
   D           G         D        G
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
          D       G  C                      F
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
C           G       D                 D
  I don't expect to sleep through the night
     D      C     G       D       G
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
    D G   C
But I say why
             F       C
Why deny the obvious child?
             F       C      G
Why deny the obvious child?
         D           G    C
And in remembering a road sign
G        D     C     G         D     G     C
  I am remembering a girl when I was young
F C        G          D         G
    And we said These songs are true
      D        G
These days are ours
      D         G
These tears are free
    D  G
And hey
C                     F   C
  The cross is in the ballpark
                    F   C    G
The cross is in the ballpark
We had a lot of fun
                       D C
We had a lot of money
   G                                                    D C
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
           D           G
Sonny gets married and moves away
C           D        G
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
C          D
Sonny gets sunnier
G             C      D
Day by day by day by day
G
  Doh, doh,  doh, doh
Doh, doh,  doh, doh
                D      C     G
Well, I've been waking up at sunrise
          D             G      D        G
I've been following the light across my room
  D     G   C                 F       C  G  D
I watch the night receive the room of my day
G      D      C       G      D        G
  Some people say the sky is just the sky
    D G
But I say
C              F       C
  Why deny the obvious child?
             F       C
Why deny the obvious child?
G   C/G G
        
C/G   G    C  G   D          C
Sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself
    D    G       C    G    D              C
How it's strange that some rooms are like cages
   D    G   C    G    D
Sonny's yearbook from high school
   C
Is down from the shelf
D       C G  D                  C
And he id-ly thumbs through the pages
          Am
Some have died
          G
Some have fled from themselves
   C    G    D    G    D  G   D
Or struggled from here to get there
C     G  C    G D          C
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
         G    C       G   D              C
Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair
                          G
Well, I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
   D           G         D        G
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
          D       G  C                      F
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
C           G       D                 D
  I don't expect to sleep through the night
     D      C     G       D       G
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
    D G
But I say
C                     F   C
  the cross is in the ballpark
             F C     G
Why deny the obvious    child?
