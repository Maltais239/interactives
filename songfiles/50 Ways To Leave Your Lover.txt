Key: Em

Em                 D              Cmaj7               B7
   "The problem is all inside your head", she said to me,
Em7                D         Cmaj7        D#dim
   The answer is easy if you take it logically.
Em7             D                Cmaj7          B7
   I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free.

There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover."

Em                      Cmaj7        B7
   She saideally not my habit to intrude,
         Em            D              Cmaj7          D#dim
Furthermore I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued,
          Em           D        Cmaj7          B7
But I'll repeat myself, at the risk of being crude.
              Em       Am7                Em        Em
There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover,
Em        Am7                Em
   Fifty ways to leave your lover."

   She saidieves me so to see you in such pain.
               Em                  D           Cmaj7    D#dim

              Em          D               Cmaj7      B7
I said: "I appreciate that and would you please explain
          Em      Am7     Em
About the - fifty ways."

Em                            Cmaj7          B7
