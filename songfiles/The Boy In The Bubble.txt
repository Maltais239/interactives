Verse
         C#m
It was a slow day
        C#m E   F#
And the sun was beating
       C#m      E      F#      E   F#    E  F#F#
On the soldiers by the side of the road
            C#m
There was a bright light
  C#m        E  F#
A shattering of shop windows
    C#m  E      F#            E   F#    E      F#F#
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio


Chorus
B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
B     E      F#   E  F#          E  F#F#
 This is the long distance call
B                   B       E     F#
 The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
B    E      F#      E  F#   E  F#F#
 The way we look to us all
B                     B       E      F#
 The way we look to a distant constellation
       B     E    F#     E  F#       E  F#F#
That's dying in a corner of the sky
B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
    B     E   F#    E     F#   E     F#F#
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

Verse
         C#m
It was a dry wind
        C#m   E         F#
And it swept across the desert
       C#m      E      F#     E  F#    E  F#F#
And it curled into the circle of birth
        C#m
And the dead sand
C#m     E      F#
Falling on the children
    C#m     E       F#      E   F#      E     F#F#
The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth


Chorus
B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
B     E      F#   E  F#          E  F#F#
 This is the long distance call
B                   B       E     F#
 The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
B    E      F#      E  F#   E  F#F#
 The way we look to us all
B                     B       E      F#
 The way we look to a distant constellation
       B     E    F#     E  F#       E  F#F#
That's dying in a corner of the sky
B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
    B     E   F#    E     F#   E     F#F#
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

Verse
       C#m
It's a turn-around jump shot
     C#m  E    F#
It's everybody jump start
     C#m   E   F#     E        F#   E      F#  F#
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
C#m                     C#m E      F#
Medicine is magical and magical is art
            C#m  E      F#
Think of the Boy in the Bubble
    E   F#        E   F#    F#
And the baby with the baboon heart


Chorus
        B                            B      E      F#
And I believe, these are the days of lasers in the jungle
B      E      F#     E   F#    E     F#F#
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
B                    B        E    F#
 Staccato signals of constant information
  B      E    F#    E  F#               E      F#        F#
A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires and baby

B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
B     E      F#   E  F#          E  F#F#
 This is the long distance call
B                   B       E     F#
 The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
B    E      F#      E  F#   E  F#F#
 The way we look to us all
B                     B       E      F#
 The way we look to a distant constellation
       B     E    F#     E  F#       E  F#F#
That's dying in a corner of the sky
B                      B   E       F#
 These are the days of miracle and wonder
    B     E   F#    E     F#   E     F#F#
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry
