Key: D

Start with riff- D  Em- Bm- A-G
D
What can still us
                 Bm       A
When our heart is racing
And stop the ticking clock when our mind is pacing
Wrestle all the demons
That we're facing
Take away the poison
That we're tasting

Riff one time or just D-Bm-A once

When our minds
Are filled with clutter
And our heartbeats skip and flutter
When we're pulled
One way or another
We should know
That we know better

Like a ship in a storm we writhe and roll
And listen to the wind that wails with woe
Realize what everybody seems to know
Were sinking

Riff or solo

When we listen to a black
Angel on our shoulder
And with dark thoughts
It grows bolder
And its grip chills us colder
While our hopes in ashes smolder

Of the ship in the storm we gained control
Took shelter in the place we know
Built it up until everybody had to know
Were back
Back
Back
and rising
