It Makes No Difference
Band
Key: D



D                        C#m
   It makes no diff'rence where I turn
F#m            E                Bm7
   I can't get over you and the flame still burns
D                         C#m
   It makes no diff'rence night or day
F#m           E              D          E
   The shadow never seems to fade away

        A   F#m       D     E    A    D   A
And the sun     don't shine   anymore
        A     F#m      D    E       A  D  A
And the rains     fall down   on my door

A
Now there's no love
Em7
As true as the love
D                B7
That dies untold
        A      F#m               D   E   A    D    A
And the clouds     never hung so low   before

D                        C#m
   It makes no diff'rence how far I go
F#m         E               Bm7
Like a scar   the hurt will always show
D                         C#m
   It makes no diff'rence who I meet
F#m               E
   They're just a face in the crowd
     D                E
On a dead-end street

        A   F#m       D     E    A    D   A
And the sun     don't shine   anymore
        A     F#m      D    E       A  D  A
And the rains     fall down   on my door

A
These old love letters
Em7
Well, I just can't keep
D
'Cause like the gambler says
B7
Read 'em and weep
        A    F#m              D  E    A     D    A
And the dawn     don't rescue me   no more

E                    C#m
   Without your love     I'm nothing at all
D                            Bm
   Like an empty hall it's a lonely fall
E                    C#m
   Since you've gone     it's a losing battle
D                          Bm                E
   Stampeding cattle, they rattle the walls

        A   F#m       D     E    A    D   A
And the sun     don't shine   anymore
        A     F#m      D    E       A  D  A
And the rains     fall down   on my door

A
Well, I love you so much
Em7
It's all I can do
D                        B7
Just to keep myself from telling you
       A     F#m        D    E   A     D    A
That I never   felt so alone   before
