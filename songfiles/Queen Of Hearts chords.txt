Midnight, and I'm awaiting on the 12:05,
                                                    G
hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line
D
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise;
                                                                    G
won't you keep my heart from breaking if it's only for a very short time?

A                G        D       A                D      G
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
                    A    D            G     A         D
The joker ain't the only fool, who'll do anything for you
A           G      D    A                D       G
Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime;
                 A       D      G        A        D
that's what I'll have to do, to keep me away from you

D
Honey, you know it makes you mad;
                                                 G
why is everybody telling everybody what you have done?
D
Baby, I know it makes you sad,

but when they're handing out the heartaches you know you got to have you
G

A                G        D       A                D      G
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
                    A    D            G     A         D
The joker ain't the only fool, who'll do anything for you
A           G      D    A                D       G
Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime;
                 A       D      G        A        D
that's what I'll have to do, to keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
                                                                     G
But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one
    D
And others, they know just what I'm going through
                                                                 G
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

A                G        D       A                D      G
Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart
                    A    D            G     A         D
The joker ain't the only fool, who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts, and knowing it ain't really smart;
                    B    E            A     B         E
the joker ain't the only fool, who'll do anything for you
B           A      E    B                E       A
Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime
                 B       E      A        B        E
That's what I'll have to do, to keep me away from you
