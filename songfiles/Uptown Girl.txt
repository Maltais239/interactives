D5          E5
Uptown girl
                         F#5          G5
She's been living in her uptown world
A5                 D5               E5
I bet she never had a back street guy
                     F#5           G5
I bet her mama never told her why
          A5
I'm gonna try for an

D5           E5
Uptown girl
                         F#5                G5
She's been living in her white bread world
           A5           D5              E5
As long as anyone with hot blood can
                            F#5           G5
And now she's looking for a downtown man
              A5
That's what I am

A#5           G5
And when she knows what
    C5            F5
She wants from her time
A#5           G5
And when she wakes up
    C5           F5
And makes up her mind

Don't know if this bit is right, but it seemed to work
G5              E5
She'll see I'm not so tough
C5
Just because
A5
I'm in love with an
D5           E5
Uptown girl
                              F#5           G5
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
              A5            D5               E5
She's getting tired of her high class toys
                              F#5            G5
And all her presents from her uptown boys
            A5
She's got a choice

F5            G5               G#5            A5      G5
                                                      
F5            G5               G#5            A5      A5
                                                      

D5            E5
Uptown girl
                           F#5             G5
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
          A5               D5               E5
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
                               F#5            G5
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
              A5
And then I'll win

A#5             G5
And when she's walking
      C5         F5
She's looking so fine
A#5             G5
And when she's talking
       C5             F5
She'll say that she's mine
G5             E5
She'll say I'm not so tough
C5
Just because
A5
I'm in love with an
