F                               Am
I listen to you time and time again

while you tell me just what’s right
F                                  Am
and you tell me a thousand things a day
Am          G         C          F

And I love you dear but just how long
           C                     G    E7
can I keep singing the same old song
      Am                  F
And I love you dear but just how long
           C                     G

And you call me to come and then I do

then you say you made some mistake
F                        Am
You invite me into your house
Am        G                  C           F

I’m going back to Kansas City

Verse 3

F                                Am
Gypsy woman, you know every place I go
Am               G     C          F
even a thousand miles away from home
F                                    Am
You don’t care if I’m asleep or I’m awake
Am           G      C              F
this fickle heart just turned to stone
F               C              E7
Going back to Kansas City
