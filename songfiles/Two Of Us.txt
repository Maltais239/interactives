Verse
G
Two of us riding nowhere
                   C    G/B    Am7
Spending someone's hard earned pay
G
You and me Sunday driving
             C  C/B Am7      G
Not arriving on our way back home
D            C   G
We're on our way home

We're on our way home
C            G
 We're going home

Verse
G
Two of us sending postcards
                C  C/B Am7
Writing letters on my  wall
G
You and me burning matches
                C  C/B Am7      G
Lifting latches on our way back home
D            C   G
We're on our way home

We're on our way home

 We're going home

You and I have memories
Gm7               Am                Am7      D7
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead


Verse
G
Two of us wearing raincoats
              C  C/B Am7
Standing solo in the sun
G
You and me chasing paper
                C  C/B Am7      G
Getting nowhere on our way back home
D            C   G
We're on our way home

We're on our way home
C            G
 We're going home
