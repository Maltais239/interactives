The Story
Brandi Carlile
Key: G
Capo on the 4th fret

Intro:
G - D - Em - C x2 (let it fade)

             G
All of these lines across my face
             D
Tell you the story of who I am
        Em
So many stories of where I've been
          C
And how I got to where I am
          G                  D
But these stories don't mean anything
     Em                   C
When you've got no one to tell them to
     G      D              G
It's true...I was made for you

continue G
I climbed across the mountain tops
           D
Swam all across the ocean blue
                  Em
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
            C
But baby I broke them all for you
        G           D
Because even when I was flat broke
    Em                  C
You made me feel like a million bucks
    G
You do
D              G
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
                D
It's hiding the words that don't come out
              Em
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
           C
They don't know my head is a mess
    G                  D
No, they don't know who I really am
    Em
And they don't know what
C                      G
I've been through like you do
D                  G
And I was made for you...

All of these lines across my face
             D
Tell you the story of who I am
        Em
So many stories of where I've been
          C
And how I got to where I am
          G                  D
But these stories don't mean anything
     Em                   C
When you've got no one to tell them to
     G      D              G
It's true...I was made for you
