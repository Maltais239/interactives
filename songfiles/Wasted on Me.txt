Wasted on Me

G
All the things that buzz and bleed
C                 D
All the things surrounding me
G
The caged birds and those flying free
    C              D
The beauty and the mystery

These columns and these tower walls
That loom above me stretching tall
The rise to glory and the fall
The painted skies above it all

Ch All these things are wasted on me x2


The fresco and the church bells ring
The call to prayer the call to sing
The rain and the new life it brings
The tell-tale signs of early spring

The bright lights that draw you near
Flame of desire, chill of fear
All the things that you call dear
the love and light that brought you here

Ch All these things are wasted on me x2

This siren and her raven hair
On the mast I only stare
That smile only you wear
Feel the sparks that got us there

Let the mail pile at the door
Pretend that it aint there no more
Stop thinking about whats in store
Silence that unending roar

You are not wasted on me
You are all I can see
