1. I`m dreaming of a white Christmas,
    D             E              A
    just like the ones I used to know
                        A7          D        Dm
    where the tree tops glisten und children listen
       A    F#m                      Bm   E
    to hear sleighbells sound in the snow.
 
    A                 Bm    E
2.  I`m dreaming of a white Christmas,
    D          E                A
    with every Christmas card I write.
                     A7        D      Dm
    May your days be merry and bright
            A        Bm    E
    and may all your Christmasses
   A
be white
