G               Em      G     Em                   G
I get up in the evening and I ain't got nothing to say
                   Em       G           Em               C
I come home in the morning  I go to bed feeling the same way
                    Am       C              Am                   G
I ain't nothing but tired      Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
          Em    G         Em                D
Hey there baby    I could use just a little help


(chorus):
D                                                        C
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark
               Am  C                    Am             G
This gun's for hire  even if we're just dancing in the dark

Solo

G                     Em      G                   Em               G
Messages keep getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round the place
                       Em     G                 Em                   C
I check my look in the mirror I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
                    Am       C        Am                    G
Man I ain't getting nowhere, I'm just living in a dump like this
                            Em       G     Em                D
There's something happening somewhere baby I just know there is


(chorus):
D                                                        C
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark
               Am  C                    Am             G
This gun's for hire  even if we're just dancing in the dark


Em                     G
You sit around getting older
C                       D                Em
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
                            G
I'll shake the world off my shoulders
C                D
Come on baby the laugh's on me


G                      Em        G              Em                 G
Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up all right
                        Em       G            Em                   C
They say you gotta stay hungry - hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
                    Am     C                          Am                        G
I'm dying for some action, I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
               Em       G               Em              D
I need a love reaction. Come on now baby gimme just one look


(chorus):
D                                                         C
You can't start a fire sitting round crying over a broken heart
               Am    C                   Am              D
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the......
                                                                  C
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
               Am    C                   Am             G         Em
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the dark
G                  Em
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
G                  Em
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
G                  Em
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
G                  Em
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
