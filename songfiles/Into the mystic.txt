Eb      Eb
           We were born before the wind
Eb
   Also younger than the sun
Bb
   'Ere the bonny boat was won
Bb                     Eb
   As we sailed into the mystic
Eb
   Hark, now, hear the sailor's cry
Eb
   Smell the sea and feel the sky
Bb
   Let your soul and spirit fly
Bb          Eb
   Into the mystic.
Gm                             Ab           Eb
        When that foghorn blows,  I will be comin' home, Mmm hmm hm
Gm                          Ab            Bb
        When that foghorn blows, I wanna hear it, I don't have to fear it
Bb     Eb
   And I  wanna rock you gypsy soul
Eb
   Just like way back in the days of old
Bb
   And magnificently we will float
Bb          Eb
   Into the mystic
   Eb ...  Bb ...  Eb
Gm                          Am  Eb
        When that foghorn blows,  you know I will be comin' home
Gm    Ab                                    Bb
        And when that foghorn whistle blows,   I've gotta hear it, I don't have
to fear it
Eb
        And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
Eb
        Just like way back in the days of old
Bb
        And together we will float
Bb               Eb
        Into the mystic ............... Come on girl!
   Eb ...  Bb ...  Eb
      Eb                        Bb     Eb
........ Too late to stop now-o-ow!......

NOTES
~~~~~
If playing the C, G, Em, F shapes with a capo, the fills become easier to play.
For example the intro can be played by playing the C-shape Eb major and hammer-
ing onto the 4th string (D string),  then using the 3rd fret on the same string
to play the final note of the fill.    I personally tend to use the 2nd and 3rd
frets on the treble-e string (string 1) to play the fill leading into the lines
"When that foghorn blows...".  Experiment with it.
As with nearly all of Van's songs, the timing of the lyrics seems free-form and
doesn't tie in with obvious beats in the rhythm.   What's important is that you
sing a word when you feel it's right,  so don't worry if you end up playing the
chord above one word when you're singing another.   You will probably  want  to
add a few treble notes to some  of  the  chords  to  match  the  original  tune
(especially the G minor chords).   Unfortunately, most of us don't have two sax
players on hand when we need them, so those gorgeous sax solos will be missing.
That's life I'm afraid.
