They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
         A              B                     E
With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swingin' hot spot

 E
Don't it always seem to go
          A                                     n.c.
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
       A                 B                E
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
  Esus E  Esus        E      Esus E  Esus        E
(Choo     bop bop bop bop, choo     bop bop bop bop)


They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

CHORUS

Hey farmer farmer, put away that D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees
please

CHORUS

Late last night I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

CHORUS TWICE (with only one chooo bop... at each end)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot (choo bop bop bop bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
