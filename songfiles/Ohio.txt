Neil Young
Key: Dm



Dm               F       C       Dm            F      C
Tin soldiers and Nixon's coming, we're finally on our own
Dm            F        C         Dm           F  C
This summer I hear the drumming, four dead in Ohio

Gm7                  C
Gotta get down to it soldiers are gunning us down
Gm7                      C
Should of been done long ago
Gm7                      C
What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
Gm7                      C
How can you run when you know?

Dm           F     C      Dm           F     C
La la la la  la la la la  La la la la  la la la
Dm           F     C      Dm           F     C
La la la la  la la la la  La la la la  la la la
