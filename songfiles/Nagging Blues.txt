I’ve got this nagging feeling
that I’m still in love with you
I’ve got this nagging nagging feeling
that I’m still in love with you
What should I do
what should I do
About this nagging feeling
that’s got me blue

I’ve got this burning sensation
that I’m still hung up on you
I’ve got this burning sensation
that I’m still hung up on you

What should I do
what should I do
About this burning sensation
that’s got me blue

You’re damn right it’s true
moving on is hard when you don’t want to

Solo


I’ve got this nagging feeling
I’ve got this burning sensation
Ive got this nagging nagging feeling
I got this burning burning sensation
that’s got me blue
