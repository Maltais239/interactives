Key: G



G      G/F#     G/E   G/D    C        C/B        C/A  C/G
I lit out from Reno I was trailed by twenty hounds
G       G/F#         G/E  G/D             C      C/B    C/A  C/G
Didn't get to sleep that night till the morning came around

CHORUS:
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D
If I get home before day light
Am                          D    riff 1 (as D - G)
I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills ...CHORUS

Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air ...CHORUS

BRIDGE:
riff 2  D
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
    C/G
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
D
Second one is prison, baby, the shefiff's on my trail
Am                            C                D   riff 3 (D - G)
and if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me
...CHORUS
