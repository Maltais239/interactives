I Taught Myself How To Grow Old
Ryan Adams
Key: C



C                                     G
Poor little rose, beaten by the rain
       Em                                      C
In the wind, in the gale, thunder and the hail
C                                       G
Sometimes I feel like I'm going insane
            Em
Without the numbness or the pain, so intense to feel
D
Especially now it added up through the years


Chorus 1:

    C           G             D     C
And I, I taught myself how to grow
            G                   D             C
Without any love, and there was poison in the rain
         G            D
I taught myself how to grow
         Am
Now, I'm crooked on the outside
        C
And the inside's broke


Verse 2:

C                                       G
Most of the time, I got nothing to say
       Em                                                    C
When I do, it's nothing, and nobody's there to listen anyway
C                                        G
I know I'm probably better off this way
       Em
I just listen to the voices on the TV 'til I'm tired
       D
And my eyes grow heavy, and I fade away


Chorus 2:

       C           G             D     C
'Cause I, I taught myself how to grow
            G                   D             C
Without any love, and there was poison in the rain
         G             D
I taught myself how to grow
           Am                      C
'Til I was crooked on the outside
         G             D     C
I taught myself how to grow
            G                   D             C
Without any love, and there was poison in the rain
         G             D
I taught myself how to grow
           Am
'Til I was crooked on the outside, inside's caved
C
Crooked on the outside, inside's caved
Am                                      C
Crooked on the outside, inside's caved
         D                  C
I taught myself how to grow old
