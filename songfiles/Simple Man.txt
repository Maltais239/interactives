Key: C

 C(add D              C      Em7              Em
I   am   a simple man, so I sing a simple song

      Am          G                  F
I've never been so much in love and never hurt so bad

      C(add D     C   C(add D    C
At the  same  time

 C(add D              C       Em7              Em
I   am   a simple man, and I play a simple tune

   Am                G             F
I wish that I could see you once again across the room

           C       G
Like the first time

   F                                               C   G
I just want to hold you, I don't want to hold you down

   F                                                      C
I hear what you're saying, and you're spinning my head around

             G        F
And I can't make it alone

C(add D    C   Em7   Em   Am   GFC(addDCC(addDC
                               
   C(add D             C        Em7               Em
The ending of the tale, is the singing of the song

 Am               G                F
Make me proud to be your man only you can make me strong

          C       G
Like the last time

   F                                               C   G
I just want to hold you, I don't want to hold you down

   F                                                      C
I hear what you're saying, and you're spinning my head around

             G        F
And I can't make it alone
