If Only Once
Darren Maltais
If only once
you could be mine
If only there was was a way that we could slow down time
If I could take
my own advice
and follow all the paths I see towards the light

If only once
Though I think that once just might not be enough

I’ve been dreaming
Oh I’ve pined
Built myself a mountain I can’t climb
But it could be as easy
as it seems
Just to put those words together
You and me

If only once
Though I think that once just might not be enough

Did you see
the stars last night?
Did wish on the one that shot across the sky
Did you wish just once
You could be mine
or did you wish it would be the first of a thousand times

Because only once, only once
I think that once just might not be enough
