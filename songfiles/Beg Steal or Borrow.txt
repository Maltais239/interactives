So your home town's bringing you down
 C                       G            D           CG
Are ya drowning in the small talk and the chatter
               D
Or you gonna step into line like your daddy done
                       G                 D        CG
Punching the time and climbing life's long ladder



You've been howling at the moon like a slack jawed fool
And breaking every rule they can throw on
But one of these days it's gonna be right soon
You'll find your legs and go and stay gone



 A         C                      G               D
Young man full of big plans and thinking about tomorrow
 A         C                          G                F
Young man going to make a stand, you beg, steal you borrow
               D          CG
Ya beg ya steal ya borrow





Well all the friends that you knew in school
They used to be so cool now they just bore you
Well look at them now, already pulling the plow
So quick to take to grain like some old mule

D.....


 Am
Dreaming of the day
Am
You're gonna pack your bags
                D
Put the miles away
           Am
Oh, just grab your girl and go
Am
Where no one knows you
                     D           GC
What will all the old folks say?

So your home town's bringing you down
