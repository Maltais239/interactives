Fragile Bird
City and Colour
Key: G
Tempo: 96 BPM
4 bars
Am
When she sleeps
G                                 D/F#
There is a fever dream, yeah
Am
It brings a night terror
G                            F#
To harm this fragile bird

(Same as above)
She speaks in tongues
Her words they come undone, yeah
And with a wayward mind
she struggles through the night

G        Am     Fmaj7
All that I can do
G                                  Am
Is hope she makes it through
Am
Through the night
G        D/F#
Through the night

Am
These cold nightmares
G                               F
They make her worse for wear
Lost in the dark
She's got a heavy heart

(Same)
And when she wakes
In her fragile state
Well, she calls my name
Hoping that I keep her safe

G
All that I can do
Am
Is hope she makes it through
All the I can do
Is hope she makes it through
solo 8 bars
Through the night
Through the night
Through the night
Through the night

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
Through the night
