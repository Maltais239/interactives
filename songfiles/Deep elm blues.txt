Deep elm blues
Jerry Garcia
Key: G



G
Once I knew a preacher,
Preached the Bible through and through,
He went down to Deep Elem,
Now his preachin' days are through.

Chorus:
C7
Oh sweet mama
                                G
Your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues.
D7
Oh sweet mama
                                G
Your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues.
G
Once I had a girlfriend.
She meant the world to me.
She went down to Deep Elem,
Now she ain't what she used to be.
(chorus)
G
When you go down to Deep Elem,
Put your money in your socks.
'Cause them women in Deep Elem
Will sure put you on the rocks.
(chorus)
G
If you go down to Deep Elem
To have a little fun,
Have your ten dollars ready
When the policeman comes.
(chorus)
Enjoy
