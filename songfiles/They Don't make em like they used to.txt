They Don't make em like they used to
Harpoonist and the Axe Murderer

Hard times we're going through
Got a woman and she can't be true
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
I had a friend but he didn't last
All he left was this knife in my back
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
I remember the days
Moving slow
And everything was new
I remember the days
Where did they go?
I guess those days are through
They don't make 'em like they used to
Welding steel
For automobiles
Machines can build what ten men couldn't do
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
Where did the land of the plenty go?
It's up above I'm six feet below
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
I remember the days
Moving slow
And everything was new
I remember the days
Where did they go?
I guess those days are through
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
Brother what's it all coming to?
Ain't nobody left can sing the blues
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
They got the body but they got no soul
They got tracks goin' solid gold
Oh well
They just don't make 'em like they used to
I remember the days
Moving slow
And everything was new
I remember the days
Where did they go?
I guess those days are through
They just don't make 'em like they used to
