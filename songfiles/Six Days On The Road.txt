Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh rolling down that Eastern seaboard
                                                     F#
I got my diesel wound up & she's arunning like never before
          E                       F#
There's a speed zone ahead on the right and

I don't see a cop in sight

Six days on the road & I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got  ten forward gears and a George Overdrive
B                                                  F#
I'm takin' little white pills & my eyes are opened wide
  E                       F#
I just passed a Jimmy and White
       B                     E

The ICC is  checkin on down the line
B                                                  F#
Well I'm a little overweight but my law books way behind
    E                  F#
But nothing bothers me tonight
           B                         E
I'm gonna dodge all the scales allright
    B                      F#                    B
Six days on the road & I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well it beens six weels since I kissed my baby goodbye
                                                        F#
I could have a lotta women but I'm not alike some other guys
        E                       F#
I could find me one to hold me tight
            B                          E
But I could never make believe it's allright
    B                      F#                    B

My rigs a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a  good flame  blowing from her  smoke stack
         F#
black as coal
        E                      F#
Well my home town's comming in sight
           B                      E
And if you think I'm happy you're right
