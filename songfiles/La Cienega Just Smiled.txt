   Oh the night, Here it comes again

It's on with the jeans, the jacket, and the shirt

Cadd9           Dsus4     G
   How'd I end up feelin' so bad

     Em7
Such a little girl

-Verse II-

Cadd9                              Dsus4      G
And I'll hold you close in the back of my mind

  Cadd9                 Dsus4          G
It feels so good, but damn it makes me hurt

Cadd9                   Dsus4       Em7   Dsus4  Cadd9
  And I'm too scared to know how i feel about you now

   Cadd9                Dsus4                  G    Cadd9 G

Cadd9                Dsus4                     G
I raise my glass cause either way i'm dead


Cadd9                   Dsus4    Em7   Dsus4  Cadd9
Neither of you really help me to sleep anymore

Em7                       Cadd9
