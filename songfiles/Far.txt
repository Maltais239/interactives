Far
Darren Maltais

Holding out your hands
Trying to catch what passes
Like looking for what's burnt
By sifting through the ashes
Trying to stop a flood, you put your finger in it
But the water all around you
Is rising by the minute

Careful fingers etch
Designs into the surface
And grateful minds can't help
But feel they don't deserve this
Pictures made of sand
Swept into the water
She's trying to unlearn
Everything you taught her

Wind won't give us peace
And the house will rock and creak
It'll push us ever faster
But every mile we make
Brings us far from what were after

Drifting on the clouds
And floating on the ocean
Lifting you up
With its gentle motion
The people you met they charmed you
With a clever potion
That quickly washed away
All your old emotions
