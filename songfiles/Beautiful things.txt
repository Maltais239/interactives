There's a space in the clouds where the sun peeks in
      C#m
And a space in time when your life begins and you
E                                               C#m
Hope the sun will shine all the time you're in bright

E
Things loom large until you look the other way
     C#m
Then things are ignored until they slip away and you
E                                                 C#m
Hope that you'll get them back someday, well good luck
I think you're gonna need it

A                  E
Oh those beautiful things
               C#m
We say after a few drinks
A                 E
Oh that beautiful light
                    C#m
I hope it lasts the night

  E
I hope that you can pull yourself together
      C#m
and I hope that we can stay and stand the weather
    E                                  C#m
but if we don't, you cant say we never tried

A                  E
Oh those beautiful things
               C#m
We say after a few drinks
A                 E
Oh that beautiful light
                    C#m
I hope it lasts the night

SOLO
STOP
EC#m


    E
The hawk and the dove dont share the same sky
    C#m
And there are those who lead
And those who wonder why
       E                                                       C#m
But it makes you think we're not looking with the same kind of eyes

A                  E
Oh those beautiful things
               C#m
We say after a few drinks
A                 E
Oh that beautiful light
                    C#m
I hope it lasts the night
