I remember you went to the waters edge
F                 C
just to soak your feet
C
all was innocent in the dry heat,
     D7                  G
when across the way your eyes did meet

F                  C
that sweet looking lady
F                     C
with something up her sleeve
F            C                 G        C
who wants to fish when there's hanky panky?

C
before you knew it together you were
F                C
both on the same side
C
ready to skip some stones and rocks,
    D7                    G
you grabbed her hand made way for the dock

F           C
undone some buttons
F            C
off with the socks
F               C
she had the key to your heart
    G                C
set off the alarm on your clock

             F           C
you're going down, going down
G         C
Blind Man River you're going
F         C         G    G7
down down down down down
          C
Blind Man River

C
time was a passing, doesn't phase you much
F                        C
when you're necking with Tessy
C
all this changed when your ma and pa came and
D7                  G
found the two of us messy
F                C
sweat up on your brow,
F                    C
stripped down to the whities
F                  C
caught us both red handed
       G                C
with a matching pair of hickies

             F           C
you're going down, going down
G         C
Blind Man River you're going
F         C         G    G7
down down down down down
          C
Blind Man River

C
so when Willie says, "Hon we're going fishin"
F                    C
I give a smile and a wink
C
we don't need no worms or poles,
      D7               G
don't give a second to ponder or think
F                 C
we'll meet by the dock,
    F            C
and off with the socks
F                C
forget and leave at home,
G                     C
that damned old alarm clock

             F           C
you're going down, going down
G         C
Blind Man River you're going
F         C         G    G7
down down down down down
          C
Blind Man River
