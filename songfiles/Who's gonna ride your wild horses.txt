You're dangerous, 'cos you're honest

You're dangerous, 'cos you don't know what you want
        G                           C

Well you tell me things I know you're not supposed to

Well you stole it 'cos I needed the cash
        G         D             C
And you killed it 'cos I needed revenge
         G                 C
Well you lied to me 'cos I asked you to

Am    Em
The deeper I spin
G                                 D
The hunter will sin ... for your ivory skin
Am
Took a drive in the dirty rain
Em
To a place where the wind calls your name
G
Under the trees the river laughing
D
At you and me...
Am
Hallelujah, heavens white rose

The doors you open I just can't close
           G         D              C
Don't you turn around, don't you turn around again
           G         D              C
Don't you turn around your gypsy heart
       G         D        C
Don't turn around, don't turn around again
       G         D                C
Don't turn around, and don't look back
        C        D
Come on now love, don't you look back

Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
 G           D                C
Who's gonna take the place of me?
 G           D             C
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
 G         D                C
Who could tame the heart of thee?
