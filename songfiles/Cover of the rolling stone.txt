Well we are big rock singers
we've got golden fingers
                              E
and we're loved everywhere we go,
we sing about beauty and we sing about thruth
E7                        A
at ten thousand dollars a show;
we take all kind of pills
to give us all kind of thrills,
                           D
but the thrill we've never known,
        E
is the thrill that'll get you
when you get your picture
                            A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone

CHORUS:
A       E
Rolling Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
A
wanna buy five copies for my mother
E
wanna see my smilin' face
       D                    A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone

I've got a freaky lady
called my Cocain Katy
                     E
who embroiders all my jeans,
I've got my poor old gray-haired Daddy,
E7              A
drivin' my limousine
Now it's all designed
to blow our minds
                               D
but our minds won't really be blown,
         E
like the blow that'll get you
when you get your picture
                            A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone

CHORUS
A       E
Rolling Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
A
wanna buy five copies for my mother
E
wanna see my smilin' face
       D                    A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone

We got a lot of
little blue-eyed, teenage groupies
                    E
who do anything we say,
we got a genuine Indian guru,
 E7                        A
who's teachin' us a better way,
we got all the friends
that money can buy,
                        D
so we never have to be alone,
       E
and we keep gettin' richer
but we can't get our picture
                            A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone
CHORUS
A       E
Rolling Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
A
wanna buy five copies for my mother
E
wanna see my smilin' face
       D                    A    A
on the cover of the Rolling Stone
        E
Rolling Stone
wanna see my picture on the cover
A
wanna buy five copies for my mother
E
wanna see my smilin' face
       D                    A
