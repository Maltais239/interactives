#        HEY, THAT\'S NO WAY TO SAY GOODBYE       LEONARD COHEN

    C#
I loved you in the morning, or kisses deep and warm
      A#m
Your hair upon the pillow, like a sleepy golden storm
     F#
Yes many loved before us, I know we are not new
     C#
In city and in forest, they smiled like me and you

     A#m
But lets not talk of love or chains, and things we can\'t untie
      F#                        G#                           C#  G#
Your eyes are soft with sorrow, hey thats no way to say goodbye


I\'m not looking for another as I wander in my time

Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme

You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me

It\'s just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea


But now its come to distances and both of us must try

Your eyes are soft with sorrow, hey thats no way to say goodbye


I loved you in the morning, or kisses deep and warm

Your hair upon the pillow, like a sleepy golden storm

Yes many loved before us, I know we are not new

In city and in forest, they smiled like me and you

But now its come to distances and both of us must try

Your eyes are soft with sorrow, hey thats no way to say goodbye
