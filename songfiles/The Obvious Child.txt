Verse

                    G
I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
   D     C     G         D        G
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
          D    C     G C                    F    C
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
          G       D                 G
I don't expect to sleep through the night
     D      C     G       D       G
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
    D C  G C
But I say why
             F       C
Why deny the obvious child?
             F       C         G
Why deny the obvious child?


Verse

         D    C      G            D  C  G
And in remembering a road sign
         D  C      G         D C   G      C    F C
I am remembering a girl when I was you-ou-oung
       G          D         G
And we said these songs are true
      D        G
These days are ours
      D         G
These tears are free and hey
C                     F   C
  The cross is in the ballpark
C                     F   C      G
  The cross is in the ballpark


Bridge

   G
We had a lot of fun
   G                     G G D* C
We had a lot of money
   G                                                      G G D* C
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
C          D           G
Sonny gets married and moves away
C           D        G
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
C          D       G             C      D      G
Sonny gets sunnier day by day by day by day

Verse

          D      C  G
I've been waking up at sunrise
          D    C        G      D        G
I've been following the light across my room
  D     C   G C               F       C  G     D  G
I watch the night receive the room of my day
     D      C        G     D        G
Some people say the sky is just the sky
    D C  G C
But I say why
             F       C
Why deny the obvious child?
             F       C         G
Why deny the obvious child?

Middle 8

 C/G
  G    C/G G   D          C
Sonny sits by  the window and thinks to himself
         G       C/G  G    D              C
How it's strange that some rooms are like cages
        G   C/G  G    D              C
Sonny's yearbook from high school is down from the shelf
C   D   G C/G G D                  C
And he id-l - y thumbs through the pages
          Am
Some have died
          G                     C  G
Some have fled from themselves
   C   D     C    G       C   D
Or struggled from here to get there
C     G  C/G  G D          C
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
         G     C/G     G   D              C
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair

  Why deny the obvious   child?
