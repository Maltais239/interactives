Intro

Verse 1
Dm         C       F
Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Dm       C      F
Ancient goblins and warlords
Dm               C         F
Come out of the ground not making a sound
Dm            C       F
The smell of Death is all around
C                       Dm
And the night when the cold wind blows
C               Dm        Bb
No one cares, nobody knows

Chorus
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again

Verse 2
Dm          C        F
Follow Victor to the sacred place
Dm          C         F
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Dm          C         F
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Dm       C      F
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
C                      Dm
And the night when the moon is bright
C                   Dm         Bb
Someone cries, something ain't right

Chorus
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb   C
I don't want to live my life again

Verse 3
Dm           C        F
The moon is full, the air is still
Dm        C       F
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Dm         C        F
Victor is grinning, flesh is rotting away
Dm         C       F
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
C                      Dm
And the night when the wolf cries out
C                Dm              Bb
Listen close and you can hear me shout

Chorus
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb     C
I don't want to live my life again
Dm                F           C       Bb
I don't wanna be buried in a Pet Sematary
Dm               C             Bb      C
I don't want to live my life again

oh, no,   oh, oh
               Dm           C      Bb     C

Dm  C   Bb C
