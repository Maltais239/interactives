D                               A7
He don't like the young folks I know
                            G     D
He told me one night on his radio show
                        Em
He's got him a medal he won in the war
          A7                              D
He weighs 500 pounds and he sleeps on the floor
D                              A7                               D
He's a drug store truck drivin man he's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
                   Em             A7                    D
When summer rolls around he'll be lucky if he's not in town
D                          A7
He's been like a father to me
                           G            D
He's the only D.J. you can hear after   three
                               Em
I'm an all night musician in a rock n roll band
    A7                                   D
And why he don't like me I can't understand
D                              A7                                D
He's a drug store truck drivin man he's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
                  Em              A7                   D
When summer rolls around he'll be lucky if he's not in town
