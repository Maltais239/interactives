Hazy shade of winter
Simon & Garfunkel
Key: Dm
Tempo: 96 BPM


lead voc, two guit.
Dm                           C
Time, Time, Time, see what's become of me,
        Bb                       Am
While I look around, for my possiblities,
         C
I was so hard to please,
         Dm                 C
But look around, leaves are brown,
        Bb       A7            Dm
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.
                   C
Hear the salvation army band.
Bb
Down by the riverside it's bound to be a better ride
     Am
than what you've got planned.
           C
Carry your cup in your hand,
         Dm                 C                  Bb
And look around, leaves are brown now, and the sky,
     A7            Dm
Is a hazy shade of winter.
                  C
Hang onto to your hopes my friend
Bb
That's an easy thing to say but if your hopes should pass away
Am
simply pretend
             C
That you can build them again
      Dm                  C                    Bb
Look around, the grass is high, the fields are ripe,
        A7                Dm
Its the spring time of my life
Bb                      F
Seasons change with the scenery,
                  C
Weaving time in a tapestry
                     Dm
Won't you stop and remember me,
C
 at any convenient time,
Bb
Funny how my memory skips while looking over manuscripts
   Am
of unpublished rhyme,
            C
Drinking my Vodka and lime,

       Dm                 C                  Bb
I look around, leaves are brown now, and the sky,
     A7            Dm
is a hazy shade of winter
      C                 Bb               A7                   Dm
Look around, leaves are brown, there's a patch of snow on the ground,
      C                 Bb               A7                   Dm
Look around, leaves are brown, there's a patch of snow on the ground,
      C                 Bb               A7                   Dm
Look around, leaves are brown, there's a patch of snow on the ground.
