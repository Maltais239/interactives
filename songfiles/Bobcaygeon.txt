Bobcaygeon
[Intro] G      Am      G     Am

G                         Am    G                     Am
I left your house this morning about a quarter after nine
G                        Am     G                 Am
Could've been the Willie Nelson, could've been the wine
Bm                            C
When I left your house this morning
G                      Am
It was a little after nine
Bm                                  C
It was in Bobcaygeon I saw the constellations
G                                Am
Reveal themselves one star at a time

G       Am      G     Am

G                         Am      G                 Am
Drove back to town this morning with working on my mind
G                     Am
I thought of maybe quitting
G                       Am
Thought of leaving it behind
Bm                       C
Went back to bed this morning
G                            Am
And as I'm pulling down the blind
Bm                      C
The sky was dull and hypothetical
G                          Am
And falling one cloud at a time

            Em                     C
That night in Toronto with its checkerboard floors
             G                    D
Riding on horseback and keeping order restored
                   Em
Til the men they couldn't hang
                C
Stepped to the mic and sang
            D
And their voices rang with that Aryan twang

G       Am     G      Am  (2x)

G                         Am    G                     Am
I got to your house this morning just a little after nine
G                        Am     G                 Am
In the middle of that riot Couldn't get you off my mind
Bm                            C
So I'm at your house this morning
       G            Am
Just a little after nine
Bm                                  C
Cause it was in Bobcaygeon where I saw the constellations
G                          Am
Reveal themselves one star at a time.
Play that Em dudes
