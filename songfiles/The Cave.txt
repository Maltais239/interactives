Verse 1:
                   C#m            E
It's empty in the valley of your heart
                   C#m            E
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
                   C#m              E             B       E
Away from all the fears and all the faults you've left behind

Verse 2 (repeat verse chords):
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same, I know the shame in your defeat

Chorus 1:
    E       A       E
But I will hold on hope
    E       A       E
And I won't let you choke
A      E       B
On the noose around your neck
     C#m         A         E
And I'll find strength in pain
    C#m      A        E
And I will change my ways
       A       E             B
I'll know my name as it's called again

Verse 3:
Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

Verse 4:
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

Chorus 2:
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again
bring it down

Verse 5:
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand

Pre-Chorus:  (same as chorus chords)
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be
