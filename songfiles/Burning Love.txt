Burning Love
Elvis Presley
Key: D


This Bug is Your Bug
D
Lord Almighty
G          A           D
I feel my temperature rising
D
Higher, higher
G             A             D
It's burning through to my soul
D
Girl, girl, girl
G                A        D
You've gone and set me on fire
D
My brain is flaming
G             A           D
I don't know which way to go


Chorus:
     Bm     A       G
Your kisses lift me higher
         Bm        A      G
Like the sweet song of a choir
    Bm       A      G
You light my morning sky
     A           D
With burning love


Verse 2:
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
It must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning
Burning and nothing can cool me
I just might turn to
Smoke, but I feel fine


REPEAT CHORUS

Bm A G A D
         

Verse 3:
It's coming closer
The flames are now lickin' my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
My chest is a heaving
Lord have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay

CHORUS

G             D   G
With burning love
          D                        G
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
       D                       G
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love  (repeat line to fade)
