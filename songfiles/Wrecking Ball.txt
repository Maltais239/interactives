Wrecking Ball
Ryan Adams
Key: F

F                             C
Driving through the streets tonight
     G                      Am
It's hot, I got the windows down
F                           C                        G
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around

F                        C
Nothing much left in the tank
    G                    Am
Somehow this thing still drives
  F                              C                 G
It forgot what it needed but somehow still survives
    C                            F         G
And all the walls we build, they must come down

F
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
          C              G        F
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down, come and knock me down
C                 G    F
Come and knock me down tonight

Lying in my bed at night, feeling like I'm somebody else
My thoughts inside my head get lost inside the haunted house
Everyone I used to know left their dreams by the door
I accidentally kick them, that's how I can tell you're still not sure
And all the walls we build, they rise and they fall
(if you want to sell them out at all)

But hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down, come and knock me down

Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Driving through the streets tonight
It's hot, I got the windows down
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around
