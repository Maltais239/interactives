If you start me up, start me up
I'll never stop
I feel running hot
You got me reaped
You gotta go watch out
You make a grown man cry
Start up a fire with the gasoline
I wont soothe whatever fllame, flame, shame
Start me up
If you start me up
Gonna start until it's all you got
I can't complete
With the honesty a lover keeps
If you roughet it up
If you locked me up
If you start me up
Ride up the wind at double speed
I'll take you to place that you'll never say

My first post to this site, so I hope it looks ok :)
As with a lot of Rolling Stones songs, Keith Richards tunes his guitar to
an 'open G' (low to high: D,G,D,G,B,D) tuning. The  6th (lowest) string is
removed when playing this song. Another more or less trademark of
Richards.
Intro:                       P          M   M





That repeats a few times up until the Chorus. Here is the Chorus

Chorus:











 = This chord is not really played. You already played it (the last chord
in the intro) The chord is just carried into the chorus.
Note that I have also not tabbed in the lowest string.
P = pull-off.
M = muted note.
 = slide up.
: = repeat.
Any probs, feel free to mail me.
Have fun :)
Mike.
