Ruby Tuesday
Rolling Stones
Key: Am


Am        G     F   G              C      F  C
She would never say where she came from
Am        G     F      C       G      C  G
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
Am        D7     G
While the sun is bright
   Am     D7      G
Or in the darkest night
       C     F  C                G      C  G
No one knows       she comes and goes

C   G   F    G
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
C         G      F       C
Who could hang a name on you ?
C        G           F
When you change with ev'ry new day
G               F    C
Still I'm gonna miss you

      Am       G       F        G       C    F  C
Don't question why she needs to be so free
       Am       G        F    G      C    F  C
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
Am       D7       G
She just can't be chained
     Am         D7        G
To a life where nothing's gained
              C    F   C           G     C  G
And nothing's lost      at such a cost

Am         G       F       G          C    F  C
There's no time to loose I heard her say
Am         G         F         G    C     F  C
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Am    D7      G
Dying all the time
Am        D7         G                   C    F
Lose your dreams and you will loose your mind
C             G      C  G
 ain't life unkind
