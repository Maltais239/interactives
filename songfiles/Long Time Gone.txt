Everly Brothers
Key: E



E
You cheated me and made me lonely
                         B7
I tried to be your very own
                       A       E
There'll be a day you want me only
                           B7              E
But when I leave       I'll be a long time gone

Chorus
                          A        E
Be a long time gone be a long time gone
                            B7             E
Yes when I leave       I'll be a long time gone

E
Your gonna be sad your gonna be weepin
                              B7
Your gonna be blue and all a lone
                             A    E
You'll regret the day you seen me leaven
                            B7              E
But when I leave        I'll be a long time gone

Chorus

A                                 E
Be a long time gone be a long time gone
                            B7             E
Yes when I leave       I'll be a long time gone

E
You'll see my face through tears and sorrow
                                    B7
You'll miss the love you called your own
                 A     E
Baby, there'll be no tomorrow
                         B7              E
'Cause when I leave, I'll be a long time gone

Chorus
A                                 E
Be a long time gone be a long time gone
                            B7             E
Yes when I leave       I'll be a long time gone
A                                 E
Be a long time gone be a long time gone
                            B7             E
Yes when I leave       I'll be a long time gone

This should be complety right if not someone tell me
