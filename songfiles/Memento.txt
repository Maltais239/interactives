I held a place for you, though I knew you couldn't come
           C
And I kept room
                         F
In my heart, my head, my bed for you

NC                   F
That's the space you occupy
The home you'd keep if you could lie
                    C
Here in the dimming light
Every day and night
     F
With me

                    Bb
All these things we keep
                   Dm
Sentimental on the mantle
                  C
As if we couldn't handle
              Bb
Just an empty space
                     C
Everything is in its place
                       F
so I keep it there, my memento

        F
I set a place for you
Though I would eat alone
                             C
somewhere you mirrored every move
Silent as a tomb
                F
you so far from home

                F
and here we are again
another trip around the sun
                     C
still nothing really changed
the deck chairs rearranged
                      F
while the band played on

                    Bb
All these things we keep
                   Dm
Sentimental on the mantle
                  C
As if we couldn't handle
              Bb
Just an empty space
               C
Nothing in its place
                       F
so i keep it there, my memento

I wrote a note for you
Some lines left upon the page
I hope you keep it there
A reminder that we share
When these players go offstage

All these things we keep
Sentimental on the mantle
As if we couldn't handle
Just an empty space
Nothing in its place
so I keep It there, my memento
Everything in it's place
Time won't erase
My keepsake, my memento
