D          G             A7
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
D              G           A
Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
D                    G         A7     D           G     A
Love like yours will   surely come my  way, (hey,  hey, hey)

Everyday, it's a gettin' faster,
D             G             A
Everyone says go ahead and ask her,
D                    G         A7     D           G     A
Love like yours will   surely come my  way, (hey,  hey, hey)

Chorus
G
Everyday seems a little longer,
C
Every way, love's a little stronger,

Come what may, do you ever long for

True love from  me?
