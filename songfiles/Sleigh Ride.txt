Sleigh Ride
Key: Db


From the album " A Christmas gift for you from Philles records" released 1963.

This version has clip clop sound effects and whinnying, and misses out the bridge section
in the original, repeating the verse and chorus a semitone higher higher each time.
There is interesting chord progression at the end.
