Tennessee Jed

Key: C



C                                  G C
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain.
Drink all day and rock all night.
I run into Charlie Fog.
F                            G       C     G C
Listen to the whistle of the evenin' train.
The law come to get you if you don't walk right.
Blacked my eye and he kicked my dog.
C7              B7   Bb7      GC
                               
You know you bound to wind up dead

Got a letter this mornin', baby and all it read:
My doggie turned to me and he said.
C      F                     G      C   G C
if you don't head back to Tennessee Jed.
"You better head back to Tennessee Jed."
"Let's head back to Tennesse Jed."

C                              G C
Rich man step on my poor head.
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine.
I woke up feelin' mean.
F                             G         C     G C
When you get back, you better butter my bread.
Honey, come quick with the iodine.
I went down to play the slot machine.
Co7    Dm7          C7

Well you know it's like I said:
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed.
The wheels turned around and the letters read,
C   F                    G        C
you better head back to Tennessee Jed.
Then you head back to Tennessee Jed.
"You better head back to Tennessee Jed."

F                           C                  G       F
Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be.
C              G     F
Baby won't you carry me
C      G      F    G C
back to Tennessee.
