Ahead By A Century
Tragically Hip
Key: D



D
First wed climb a tree
D
and maybe then wed talk
D
or sit silently
D
and listen to our thoughts
Cadd9
with illusions of someday
D
casting a golden light
C
no dress rehearsal,
D
this is our life

Intro Riff (x2)

Pre-Chorus
D                               Cadd9
thats where the hornet stung me
                         D
and I had a feverish dream
                Cadd9
with revenge and doubt
                       D
tonight, we smoke them out

Chorus
A                         G/B                         A
You are ahead by a century, you are ahead by a century, you are ahead
            G/B
by a century

Intro Riff (x4)

Verse 2
D
Stare in the morning shroud
D
and then the day began
D
I tilted your cloud
D
you tilted my hand
Cadd9(drums enter same time)
rain falls in real time
D
and rain fell through the night
C                  D
no dress rehearsal, this is our life

Intro Riff (x2) (really hold on the D chord for the length of two intro riffs and
have an electric w/distortion strum Dsus2, the Dsus2 Csus2 for the next prechorus)

Pre-Chorus
D                             Cadd9
Thats when the hornet stung me
                    D
and I had a serious dream
                Cadd9
with revenge and doubt
                        D
tonight, we smoked them out
