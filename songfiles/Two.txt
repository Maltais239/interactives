(Guitar 3, Riff 1)

(Guitar 1)
   A              D
If you'll take me back
A            D
Back to your place
     A          D             E
I'll try not to bother you, I promise
            A            D
'Cause it's cold in here
      A           D
And I wish it was hot
    A                  D                E
The sink's broke, it's leaking from the faucet


(Guitar 1 + Guitar 2)
        F#m7               D
And I'm fractured from the fall
      A               E
And I wanna go home
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take one
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take only one


(Guitar 1)
         A               D
Well, my money's no good
         A             D
When I'm up to no good
   A         D              E
No good ever comes from it, honest
        A                  D
I got a really good heart
       A                    D
I just can't catch a break
           A                  D                    E
If I could, I'd treat you like you wanted me to, I promise


(Guitar 1 + Guitar 2)
        F#m7               D
But I'm fractured from the fall
      A               E
And I wanna go home
        F#m7               D
And I'm fractured from the fall
      A               E
And I wanna go home
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take one
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take one
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take one
F#m7             D                     A
It takes two when it used to take only one
