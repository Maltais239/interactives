thought that luck was on my side
                            G7
Found love when it tried to hide
    C
But love left as fast as it came
        G                          EmDG
And I'm standing in the dark again
E F# G on the uh huhs

G
Rooms filled with picture frames
                        G7
Of people who no longer know my name
C
First they're here then gone the next minute
     G                                     EmDG

Hearts depart or they draw you near
                   G7
Love gets muddy or it gets clear
C
It gets stronger or it disappears
    G                                  EmDG
You might trade laughter for some tears

G
Into the black, out of the blue
                     G7
First it was us then it was just you
    C
The skies opened up again
  G                            EmDG
I know I need a hard, hard rain
