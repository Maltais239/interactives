Wrote a Song for Everyone
Creedence Clearwater Revival
Key: G



G            D      C               G
Met myself a common  county welfare line
                C           G               D
I was a-feelin' strung out, hung out on the line
G            D     Em                   C
Saw myself a-goin'   down to the war in June
G           D                C              G
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune

CHORUS:
C                G
 Wrote a song for everyone
C                 G
 Wrote a song for truth
C                 G       Em
 Wrote a song for everyone--
       C             D7      G
When I couldn't even talk to you

Verse 2:
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication fails
If you see the answer, now's the time to say
All I want, all I want is to get you down to pray

(chorus)

(instrumental, same pattern as verses)

(chorus)

Verse 3:
Saw the people standin' a thousand years in chains
Somebody said it's a-different now; look, it's just the same
Pharaohs spin the message round and round the truth
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?

(repeat chorus 3 times; third time, with extra measure and instrumental
break, sing "cou-ou-ou-ou-ouldn't")

G        C     D   G     C     D
(you)
G     C     D   G
                
(Drummers: at single, final strum of G, tap cymbals and fade)
