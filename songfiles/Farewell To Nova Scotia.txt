Verse 1

G
The sun was setting in the west
    Em
The birds were singing on every tree
     G      D
All nature seemed inclined for to rest
     Em          C      Bm      Em
But still there was no rest for me


Chorus

    G
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you seabound coast
         Em
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
         G          D
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
         Em           C         Bm       Em
Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?


Verse II

  G
I grieve to leave my native land
  Em
I grieve to leave my comrades all
       G        D
And my parents, whom I held so dear
       Em           C             Bm   Em
And my bonny, bonny lassie that I do adore


Chorus

    G
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you seabound coast
         Em
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
         G          D
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
         Em           C         Bm       Em
Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?


Verse III

    G
The drums do beat and the wars do alarm
   Em
My captain calls, I must obey
   G             D
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia's charm
         Em           C                Bm         Em
For it's early in the morning, I'll be far, far away


Chorus

    G
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you seabound coast
         Em
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
         G          D
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
         Em           C         Bm       Em
Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?


Verse IV

  G
I have three brothers and they are at rest
      Em
Their arms are folded on their breasts
      G         D
But a poor and simple sailor just like me
        Em         C             Bm         Em
Must be tossed and driven on the dark, blue sea
