Take Me Home Country Roads
Toots and the Maytalls
Key: G

G             Em
Almost heaven, West Jamaica,
D
True ridge mountains
C                G
Shining down the River.
G
All my friends there,
Em
Older than those ridge,
D
Younger than the mountains,
C              G
Blowin' like a breeze

G                     D
Country roads, take me home,

       Em        C
To the place I belong:
       G             D
West Jamaica, my ol' mama,
        C             G
Take me home, country roads.

Em          D
I heard her voice
       G                Em
In the mornin' hour she calls me,
      C          G             D
Said "Son, you remind me of my home far away,"
    G                D             C
And drivin' down the road I feel a sickness, I sure did,
   D
Oh yesterday, yesterday.

G                Em
All my memories, oh, gathered 'round her,
D            C               G
My old lady, stranger to the water.
G               Em
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
D
Miss the taste of moonshine,
C                  G
Tears gone from my eyes.

G                     D
Country roads, take me home,

       Em        C
To the place I belong:
       G               D
West Jamaica, my my my mama,
                        C             G
Oh won't you take me go home, country roads.



Repeat chorus until fade.
