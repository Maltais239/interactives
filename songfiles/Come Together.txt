Dm7
Here come old flat top, He come grooving up slowly,
Dm7
He got Joo Joo eyeball, He one holy roller
       A
He got hair down to his knee;
G7
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please.



Dm7
He wear no shoe shine, he got toe jam football
Dm7
He got monkey finger, he shoot co-ca cola
        A
He say, "I know you, you know me."
G7
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
     B                 G   G/A            Dm7
Come Together, Right   now ,       over me



Dm7
He bag production, He got wal-rus gumboot
Dm7
He got O-no sideboard, He one spinal cracker
       A
He got feet down below his knee
G7
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
     B                 G   G/A            Dm7
Come together, right   now ,       over me



Dm7
He roller coaster, he got early warning
Dm7
He got muddy water, He one Mo-jo filter
        A
He say, " One and one and one is three."
G7
Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see
     B                 G   G/A            Dm7
Come together, Right   now ,       over me
