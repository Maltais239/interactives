Late in the Evening
in F
Tempo: 96 BPM
two guitars, alternate verses

First thing I remember I was lying in my bed,
Couldn't've been no more than one or two,
And I remember there's a radio,
Coming from the room next door,
While my mother laughed the way some ladies do,
Well, it was late in the evening, and all the music seepin' through.

Next thing I remember, I am walking down the street,
Feelin' all right with my boys and with my troops, yeah,
Down along the avenue some guys were shooting pool and I
Heard the sound of a cappella blues, yeah,
Singing late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah.

Then I learned to play some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J,
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move,
And I turned my amp up loud and began to play
It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away.

First thing I remember when you came into my life,
Said, I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do,
Well, I guess I've been in love before
And once or twice been on the floor
But I never loved no one the way that I love you,
And it was late in the evening, and all the music seepin' through.
