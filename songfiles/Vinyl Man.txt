Vinyl Man
Mike Undershultz
Key: G


GD
Digging records from the rock mines
CG
Throwing slag off the main line
GD
Searching for the lost B-sides
CG
He's got a bag full all the time
GA
Hauls them up to the station at night and he's

Chorus:
G         D         A
Putting a needle on vinyl
G           D           A
Kicking the jams on the air
       G           D     A
He's a rock n roll radio rival baby
    G             D      A
And he don't even really care
GA
    

GD
He's dropped more needles than a junkie
CG
He isn't in it for the money
GD
They all eye him through the booth glass
CG
It don't sound to them like progress
GA
He does't care if he's making a scratch, he's just

Chorus 2

GD
Hits the post on the front sell
CG
But never made in the retail
GD
Waisting time in the record shop
CG
Got accused of lifting product
GA
But he didn't do it he'll swear on the bible, he's still

Chorus 3:
G         D         A
Putting a needle on vinyl
G           D           A
Kicking the jams on the air
       G           D     A
He's a rock n roll radio rival baby
    G             D      A
And he don't even really care
       G     D    A
It's a radio wave affair
G           D           A
Kicking the jams on the air
G                D       A
Spinning like he doesn't care
