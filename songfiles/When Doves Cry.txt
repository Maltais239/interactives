1st Verse
Am                    G
Dig if you will the picture
    Em                     F  G
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
Am                       G
The sweat of your body covers me
Em
Can you my darling
 F         G
Can you picture this?

Am                    G
Dream if you can a courtyard
    Em                   F  G
An ocean of violets in bloom
Am                G
Animals strike curious poses
Em
They feel the heat
     F           G
The heat between me and you

Chorus
Am                           G
How can you just leave me standing?
Em                          F   G
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Am                    G
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Em                       F     G
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Am                          G
Maybe you're just like my mother
Em              F    G
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Am                        G
Why do we scream at each other
Em
This is what it sounds like
 F     G
When doves cry

Verse 2
Am                      G
Touch if you will my stomach
Em                     F   G
Feel how it trembles inside
Am                    G
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Em
Don't make me chase you
F     G
Even doves have pride
