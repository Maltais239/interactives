I can see you sitting across from me
        F              G         C
On the other side of the room
Don’t  you worry, I know it’s
Only my imagination playing tricks on me

CH
You’re as vivid as life and as real as love,love
Though you’re not here
I feel your presence is near

I’ll admit that I miss you and that
I’ll always wonder what we could have been
You bring me peace and you sprinkle your
Sweetness all over my dreams
