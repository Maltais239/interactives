Quit Sometime
Mike Undershultz


You dont have to say it
because you wrote it in the sky
You dont have to weigh it
because the scale dont go that high

The road is twisting turning
but there is nothing on the side
The birds ar chirping singing
saying why why why

The earth

Now my radio is playing
I'm geting audio vibes
The drumming on an off beat
like an african tribe
