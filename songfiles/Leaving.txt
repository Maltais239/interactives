Leaving
Darren Maltais

You can't always like what you've become
Everybody thinks that they're the chosen one
I always feel better when I'm on the run
Hard as hell to hold on to what's already gone

You know what they say, any port in a storm
I'm always partial to any bed that's warm
Never mean to do it but I'm always doing harm
I like my danger in its simplest form

And it's high time I was leaving

You won't stop once you begin
Because our darker demons always win
I don't believe in saints, much less in sin
Find myself doing the same things again and again

And it's high time for leaving

Those dark spells are blacker for some
I always liked my poison with a little sun
Don't mind feeling empty if I'm not the only one
Might as well finish what we've begun

And it's high time for leaving
