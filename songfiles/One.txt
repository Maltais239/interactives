Verse

Bm          Gmaj7
I can't remember   anything
Bm                     Gmaj7
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Bm                  D/A
Deep down inside I feel to scream
Gmaj7
This terrible silence stops me

Bm                  Gmaj7
Now that the war is through with me
Bm               Gmaj7
I'm waking up, I cannot see
Bm                     D/A
That there is not much left of me
Gmaj7
Nothing is real but pain now


Chorus

G5  A5   B5   A5 G5 F#5  B5      A5
Hold my breath as I wish for death
B5 C#5 B5  A5
       Oh please, God, wake me


Verse

Bm          Gmaj7
Back in the womb it's much too real
Bm                     Gmaj7
In pumps life that I must feel
Bm                  D/A
But can't look forward to reveal
Gmaj7
Look to the time when I'll live

Bm                  Gmaj7
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Bm               Gmaj7
Just like a wartime novelty
Bm                     D/A
Tied to machines that make me be
Gmaj7
Cut this life off from me


Chorus

G5  A5   B5   A5 G5 F#5  B5      A5
Hold my breath as I wish for death
B5 C#5 B5  A5
       Oh please, God, wake me

       Oh God, help me
G5   A5  B5    A5 G5 F#5   B5      A5
Hold my breath as I  wish for death
B5 C#5 B5   A5     B5   C#5 G5
       Oh please, God, help me

E5
Darkness imprisoning me

All that I see

Interlude

E5
Landmine has taken my sight

Taken my speech
         F5
Taken my hearing
E5
Taken my arms

Taken my legs

Taken my soul
             F5
Left me with life in hell
