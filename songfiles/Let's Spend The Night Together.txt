Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind
        E7
(oh my, da da da da da da da da)
A                     G#m
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
        E7
(oh my, da da da da da da da da)
D                                       A
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied
D
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
C#m
(I'm high, but I try, try, try...oh my)
E7
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
                               A      G#mE7
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologise
(oh no, let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down
We could have fun just grooving around
(around and around oh my, my)
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
D
Let's spend the night together
A
Now I need you more than ever
D
Let's spend the night together

A
You know I'm smiling, baby
D
You need some guiding, baby
A
I'm just deciding, baby
    E
Now I need you more than ever
E7
Let's spend the night together
                                      A G#mE7
Let's spend the night together now

This doesn't happen to me every day
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need
And now I know you will satis#capo fret 3:# E-1---------0---------0---------3---------1---------0---------# G-2---------0---------3---------3---------3---------2---------# A-3---------2---------3---------3---------1---------0---------
