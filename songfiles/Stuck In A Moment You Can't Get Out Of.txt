E  E/G#  A  E/G#  B  C#m  A  E
                               VERSE:
E       E/G#      A                E/G#
I'm not afraid of anything in this world
        B               C#m                A                E
There's nothing you can throw at me that I haven't  already heard
E                  E/G#   A         E/G#
I'm just trying to find a decent melody
  B               C#m        A        E
A song that I can sing in my own company
C#m                        A
I never thought you were a fool
F#m          A
(2nd verse)
But darling, look at you
C#m                A                          C#m
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
                      B
These tears are going nowhere, baby

E      E/G#   A            E/G#
You've got to get yourself together
           B          C#m                A         E
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
E     E/G#     A             E/G#              G#/C       C#m
Don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
        A                  E
And you can't get out of it

E          E/G#         A                E/G#
I will not forsake, the colours that you bring
But the nights you filled with fireworks
     A                   E
They left you with nothing
E          E/G#             A                    E/G#
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me
                                                   A
I still listen through your ears, and through your eyes I can see
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough, and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now... my oh my
E      E/G#   A            E/G#
You've got to get yourself together
           B          C#m                A         E
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
E     E/G#     A             E/G#              G#/C       C#m
Don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
        A                  E
And you can't get out of it

F#m
I was unconscious, half asleep
    A                                   E
The water is warm till you discover how deep...
F#m
I wasn't jumping... for me it was a fall
A                                  D  B
It's a long way down to nothing at all

E   E/G#   A          E/G#
And if the night runs over
B   C#m    A         E
And if the day won't last
E   E/G#   A          E/G#
And if our way should falter
G#/CC#mA    E
        (1st x only)
Along the stony pass

It's just a moment
               E
This time will pass
