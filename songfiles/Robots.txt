Intro
Em



Verse 1
Em                    G          C
I don’t know what you’ve been told
Em                     G          D     C
But I don’t get out much these days
Em                  G
Waking young and feeling old
    C
The days are no longer my own
   Em            G         D     C
To piss away the waking hours


Chorus
    Em
But don’t, don’t, don’t
      C
Don’t let them go
Em
Don’t, don’t, don’t
      C                 G
Don’t let them go to waste
               D               Em
The fire in my eye is fleeting now
           C
Your robot heart is bleeding


Verse 2
Em              G     C
Tried to be the robot king
Em                G     D     C
And settled for a robot boy
Em                  G
Ring the bells that still can ring
    C
And sing your stupid head off to
Em            G      D    C
The ones who are not listening


Bridge
    G                     D
And I've spend half of my life
                        Em
In the customer service line
                  C
Flaws in the design
                  G
A sign of the times

                  D
And that little voice
                    Em
In the back of your mind
                     C
Just wants you to know
                       C
Just hopes that you know


Outro
G                D
Robots need love too
                         Em
They want to be loved by you
                         C
They want to be loved by you.
                      G
They want to be loved by
(repeat indefinitely)
