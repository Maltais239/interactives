Key: D

D        C              G
Hey, are you scared and tired?
D       C                 G
Hey, is your mind running wild?
C   G      D G    C        G
I'm young, I know but even so
C    G    D        G
It's hard when you know
C                       G
Sometime all of this is gonna go

    D  C    G
But wasting time
D    C G
It's alright
D  C    G
Wasting time
D    C G
It's alright

Hey, where'd the money go
It slips away before you know
I'm dumb, I know, but even so
I've got a thought or two you know
Spinning in the globe

Chorus

Hey, where did all the time go
It slips away before you know
I'm done I know
Yeah but even so
I dont want to go
Want to stay with you, you know

chorus
