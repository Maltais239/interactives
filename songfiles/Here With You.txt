Dm          C    G                  Dm
I've walked down that long lonesome road
              C             Am            G
I've felt the northern wind blow hard and cold
Dm                C
I was looking for shelter
G                  Dm
A place to ease my mind
F        C
When you touched me
  Am                      G
I knew for the very first time
That,

F       C     Am        G
This is where I like to be
F           C           Am        G
This is the place where I can see clearly
F                    C    G              Dm
Where the trees grow tall and the sky is blue
Dm     C    Am                G
I just want to stay here with you
Dm     C    Am                G
I just want to stay here with you
             F
Here with you

Dm       C    G           Dm
When I'm gone so far from you
                C                 Am       G
Some songs just ring out loud and sound so true
Dm               C           G           Dm
From "Across The Borderline" to "Harvest Moon
F            C     Am           G
sometimes my heart, it sings in tune

F       C     Am        G
This is where I like to be
F           C           Am        G
This is the place where I can see clearly
F                    C    Am             G
Where the trees grow tall and the sky is blue
Dm     C    Am                G
I just want to stay here with you
Dm     C    Am                G
I just want to stay here with you
Here with you
Here with you
Here with you
Here with you
