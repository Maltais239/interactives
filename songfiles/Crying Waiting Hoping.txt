Crying,    Waiting,    Hoping     you'll come back,

I just can't seem to get you off my mind.

Crying,    Waiting,    Hoping     you'll come back,

You're the one I love and I think about you all the time.

Chorus
D
Crying.
   G          C       G
My tears keep falling all night long.
D
Waiting.
   G        C         G         D
It feels so useless I know it's wrong to keep

G     C G  D      G D  G     C G  C
Crying,    Waiting,    Hoping     you'll come back,
      G       C    G         D          G      D  G     C    G
Maybe someday soon things'll change and you'll be mine.
