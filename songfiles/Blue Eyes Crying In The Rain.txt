Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain
Verse
Key: B

E                             Bass run  A A# B
In the twilight glow I see her
B                        E
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
E                                  Bass run A A# B
When we kissed good-bye and parted
  B                      E     Bass run  E F F# G# A
I knew we'd never meet again


Chorus

A                          Bass run  A G# F# E
Love is like a dying ember
E               B7    Bass run  B A G# F#
Only memories remain
 E
And through the ages I'll remember
B7                        E
Blue eyes crying in the rain


(Instrumental)

A                               Bass run A G# F# E
Someday when we meet up yonder
E                          B7    Bass run  B A G# F#
We'll stroll hand in hand again

In the land that knows no parting
B7                      E
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
B7                        A     A/G#  A/F#  E  Esus4  E
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
