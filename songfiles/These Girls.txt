G                       D               Am      C
Well, girl sometimes i feel just like a boy
G               D               Am              C
Put here on this earth for you to toy around with
G                       D                               Am      C
Like matchbox cars you buy and burn in your backyard
G                       D               Am              C
Like monsters underneath your bed you ain't afraid of yet

        Bm   C  D
But you let me in
        Bm C    D
And i feel alright
        Bm C    D
Yeah, i feel alright

G                       D                       Am         C
The late night girls are anxious And they're coming out to play
G                               D               Am         C
And i've been stranded on their doorstep for every night and day
        G    D    Am            E               Am              C       D
I only want them more, it's so sad but when they smile God, i've been had
        Am              C          D
I get hypnotized and i wanna go to bed

G                D                      Am      C
I used to pick up shells cast off the reef
G                       D               Am              C
One christmas i got a funeral and they handed me the receipt
G                       D               Am      C
How ever many lies i tell without my tongue
G                       D               Am      C
Get twisted into memories 'til i believe them some
        Bm  C   D
And i toy with you
        Bm  C   D
And you toy with me
        Bm  C   D
Can you stop this please

G                       D                       Am             C
God bless all the late night girls, and they're coming out to play
G                               D               Am         C
And i've been stranded in their doorstep for every night and day
        G    D    Am            E               Am      C                   D
I only want them more, it's so sad but when they smile how can anybody feel bad
                Am      C               D
It makes me tired and i wanna go to bed

G                       D               Am              C
These are better off in my head
G                       D               Am              C
These girls are better off in my head
G                       D               Am              C
These girls are better off in my head
G               D               Am              C
These girls

**This is as close as I could get, probably not right but it works for me. ***
