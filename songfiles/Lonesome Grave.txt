Lonesome Grave
Darren Maltais
upbeat blues in E. A harp

Lay me down to sleepx3
In my lonesome grave
I won't moan and I won't weep
About my bitter fate

Now the wind is blowingx3
All around my grave
Can't feel its bite or hear its moan
In my lonesome grave

The clouds are laying lowx3
Low around my grave
I cant see them cover up
the stones around my grave

now the rain is fallingx3
falling on my grave
can't see the drops
or feel them fall
fallin' on my grave

now the sun is shining
shining on my grave
I want to feel that sunlight come
And touch me where I lay
