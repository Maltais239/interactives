December Heart
The warm and sunny climes
Always appealed to you
I always gravitated towards
A morbid point of view
You see beauty in the sunset
I only see day's end
Night's become my enemy
It's your own dark friend

It's December in my heart
Though you, you may be warm
You raise your face up to the sky
While I hide from the storm

Though the frost of winter
Has not yet touched the ground
In my mind that icy hand is stretching all around
and I wonder where it started
these nights like bitter pills
that pull my mind through places
dragged along at will

December in my mind
Though you don't feel its chill
You've been sheltered from those bleak thoughts
And I think you always will

When clouds cover up the sky
You may be thankful of the shade
I think of those clouds unleashing
Hell on what we made here
And lighting and thunder
Shake us to our bones
You hold your fears close to your heart
And make them your own

December in my mind
Quiet mid-winter's sleep
No sound carries, nothing stirs
Under snow like blankets deep
The taste of your sweet wine is dulled
By knowledge of its end
To see the cup near empty
Not to be filled up again

December in my mind
In your mid-summer's day
At least well both drink deeply
Before summer fades away
December in my heart
