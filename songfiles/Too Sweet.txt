Verse 1
Gm

            Am          Bb
It can't be said I'm an early bird
          C    D                   Eb
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
                      F
Baby, I can never tell
                     D
How do you sleep so well?
                        Gm
You keep tellin' me to live right
               Am       Bb
To go to bed before the daylight

             C    D               Eb
But then you wake up for the sunrise
                                 Bb
You know you don't gotta pretend
               Am
Baby, now and then

Pre-Chorus
                            Gm
Don't you just wanna wake up

Dark as a lake
         Am    Bb
Smellin' like a bonfire
               C D
Lost in a haze?
                   Eb
If you're drunk on life, babe

I think it's great
                       F
But while in this world

Chorus
   D                         Gm
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
                  Am   Bb
My coffee black and my bed at three
                       Eb
You're too sweet for me
                       F  D
You're too sweet for me
                  Gm
I take my whiskеy neat
                Am     Bb
My coffee black and my bed at three
                       Eb
You're too sweet for mе
                       F D
You're too sweet for me

Verse 2
         Gm
I aim low
                    Am Bb
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
                          C        D     Eb
I work late where I'm free from the phone

And the job gets done
        F                  D
But you worry some, I know
                               Gm
But who wants to live forever, babe?
                    Am           Bb            C  D
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
                                Eb
The rest of you like you're the TSA
                            Bb
I wish that I could go along
                      Am
Babe, don't get me wrong


Pre-Chorus
                                    Gm
You know you're bright as the morning

As soft as the rain
               Am Bb
Pretty as a vine
                    C  D
As sweet as a grape
                    Eb
If you can sit in a barrel

Maybe I'll wait
              F
Until that day

Chorus
    D                         Gm
I'd rather I'll take my whiskey neat
                  Am   Bb
My coffee black and my bed at three
                       Eb
You're too sweet for me
                       F  D
You're too sweet for me
                  Gm
I take my whiskеy neat
                Am     Bb
My coffee black and my bed at three
                        Eb
You're too sweet for mе
                       F D
You're too sweet for me

You're too sweet for mе
