Could you pull this weight off my chest?
                                          E     lick
Could you promise me eternal rest in your arms?
        F#m  E     A
Or does dark sleep wait
     D    A     E
Does dark sleep wait
     F#m  E     A
Does dark sleep wait

Watch the shadow creeping across the lawn
                                   E  lick
It's just time movin on and on and on
F#m   E  A
Never to wait
    D     A  E
No, never to wait
F#m   E  A
Never to wait

And how the mighty empires fall
                                    E   lick
Now they're dust swirling around us all
   F#m  E   A
Is that our fate?
   D    A   E
Is that our fate?
   F#m  E   A
Is that our fate?

Oh we stand by watching time fly
                                            Elick
And disappear like so many drops into a tide
   F#mE       A
Of water and waves
D A       E
Water and waves
F#mE       A
Water and waves

A
I ask of you what you can ask of me
                            Elick
Hold me close in your memory
F#m   E  A
Never to fade
D     A  E
Never to fade
F#m   E  A
Never to fade
