I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
         A
Although now,
                          E
Most of my days are spent alone.

   A thousand miles,
                     E
From the place I was born.

She takes me back home.

Now, most days,
               D
I spend like a child.

Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind.

I'm still afraid to turn on the lights.
