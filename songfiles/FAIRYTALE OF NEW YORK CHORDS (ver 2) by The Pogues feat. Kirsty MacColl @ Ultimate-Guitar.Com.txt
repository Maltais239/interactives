They've got cars

They've got rivers of gold
        D
But the wind goes right through you
                      A
It's no place for the old

When you first took my hand

On a cold Christmas Eve

You promised me

Broadway was waiting for me

We kissed on the corner

Then danced through the night

I've built my dreams around you
