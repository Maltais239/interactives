That Was Your Mother

Key: F
F
A long time ago, yeah before you was born dude
                 C              F
when I was still single and life was great
I held this job as a traveling salesman
    C                F
that kept me moving from state to state

F
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
C                             F
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
C
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
F
Dancing to Zydeco

F
Along come a young girl, she's pretty as a prayerbook
            C              F
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck
           C                   F
If that's my prayerbook, Lord let us pray

F
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
C                               F
Wondering what a city boy could do
To get a little conversation
Maybe drink a little red wine
C
Dance to the music of Clifton Chenier
F
The King of the Bayou

F
Well, that was your mother, and that was your father
               C                    F
Before you was born dude, when life was great
You are the burden of my generation
         C                     F
I sure do love you.  Let's get that straight

F
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
Across the street from The Public
C                            F
Heading down to the Lone Star Cafe
Maybe get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
C
Standing in the shadow of Clifton Chenier
F                 C  F
Dancing the night away
