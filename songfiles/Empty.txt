Key: Am

Capo 2nd Fret
Standard Tuning

The second version of this song is spot-on, short of one chord. I prefer to use the capo
as it seems to flow better, imho.

Verse

    F
She lifts her skirt up to her knees
                                                  C
Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughing
        F
I never learned to count my blessings
                                    C
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters


Verse

  Am
I walk on down the hill
        E
Through grass, grown tall and brown
               F                             C
And still it's hard, somehow, to let go of my pain
Am
  On past the busted back
        E
Of that old and rusted Cadillac
     F                                C
That sinks into this field, collecting rain


Chorus

       C G    F    Am     E  E7
Will I always feel this way
   C  G   F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged

Am



Verse

             F
And of these cutthroat busted sunsets,
                                           C
These cold and damp white mornings, I have grown weary
              F
If through my cracked and dusted dime-store lips
                                           C
I spoke these words out loud, would no one hear me?


Verse

         Am
Lay your blouse across the chair
    E
Let fall the flowers from your hair
    F                                  C
And kiss me with that country mouth, so plain
   Am                                  E
Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves

To me, it sounds like they're
  F                                C
applauding us, the quiet love we've made


Chorus

       C G    F    Am     E  E7
Will I always feel this way
   C  G   F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged

Verse

        F
Well, I looked my demons in the eyes
                                          C
Laid bare my chest, said “Do your best to destroy me
              F
You see, I've been to hell and back so many times
                          C
I must admit, you kind of bore me.”


Verse

          Am
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
          E
There's a lot of ways to die
         F                            C
Yes, and some already did that walk beside me
          Am
There's a lot of things I don't understand
    E
Why so many people lie
               F                                 C
Well, it's the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me


Chorus

       C G    F    Am     E    E7
Will I always feel this way
   C  G   F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged

Am
