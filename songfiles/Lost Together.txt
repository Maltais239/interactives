Strange and beautiful are the stars tonight
G    D                 Em
That dance around your head

In your eyes I see that perfect world
G           D                 Em          C

G       D          Em    D              G        D           Em
so much controlled by so few, stumbling from one disaster to another
C                         D     D         G / / / C
I've heard it all so many times before
C          D           Em     Em          D
it's all a dream to me now, a dream to me now

G           D           Em       D    G          D         Em
and in that second of a shooting star somehow it all makes sense
