Is your heart a map,
                               G#
Do I need to carve out my territory
Am I some invading force
                       C#
Dying on this hill for glory

    C#
The lines on your hands
Fm
Tell me of your past
     G#                         C#
They carve out the tale of your living
Do they demarcate
              Fm
The bounds of love, the bounds of hate
        G#               C#
Where I wait outside the borders


C#
Is your heart a map,
                               G#
Do I need to carve out my territory
Am I some invading force
                       C#
Dying on this hill for glory


C#
I ignored the signs
    Fm
Got lost on roads that wind
           G#                     C#
Could your mapped out heart be my guide now
I thought I was the master
Fm
Thought I was the maker
               G#
But we're all wrong
                C#
And we find out later


C#
Is your heart a map,
                               G#
Do I need to carve out my territory
Am I some invading force
                       C#
Dying on this hill for glory

I did not mean to be here
    Fm
Did not intend this venture
       G#                             C#
Didn't mean to wander into your heart now
C#
I followed the stars
        Fm
The dim trail of broken hearts
    G#                            C#
Got lost in this place bright and foreign


C#
Is your heart a map,
                               G#
Do I need to carve out my territory
follow you follow the stars, follow my heart
                   F#    C#
should I trust and followblindly
