 E            B7
(Sweet, sweet memories you gave to me
E                  B7
You can't beat the memories you gave to me)

E        B7               E    B7E       B7               E     B7
Take one fresh and tender kiss,Add one  stolen night of bliss,

A         E        B7          E
One girl; one boy; some grief; some joy:
E   B7               E    B7
Memories are made of this.

E        B7              E    B7E       B7             E     B7
Don't forget a small moonbeam.Fold it lightly with a dream.

A         E        B7       E
Your lips and mine,Two sips of wine:
    B7              E
Memories are made ofthis.

A                          E
Then add the wedding bells;One house where lovers dwell;
B7                        E      E7
Three little kids for the flavor.
A                               E
Stir carefully through the days.See how the flavor stays.

These are the dreams you will savor.

E        B7              E    B7
With His blessings from above,
E        B7              E    B7
Serve it generously with love.

A        E        B7       E
One man, one wife,One love,through life:

E   B7               E    B7
Memories are made of this.
