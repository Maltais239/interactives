One of These Days
Neil Young
Key: D



D
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
A          F#m
To all the good friends
     D
I've known
A             F#m
And I'm gonna try
D
To thank them all for the good times together
A         F#m
Though so apart
      D
We've grown

(Chorus)
A
One of these days
Em
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
D                            B7
To all the good friends I've known
A            F#m (Fill II)
One of these days
A            F#m (Fill II)
One of these days
A            F#m
One of these days
       D
And it won't be long
   E
It won't be long

Fill (I) + (II if you want)

And I'm gonna thank
That old country fiddler
And all of those rough boys
Who play that rock'n'roll
I never tried
To burn any bridges
Though I know I let some
Good things go

(Chorus)
One of these days
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long
It won't be long

>From down in LA
All the way to Nashville
New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are all scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak
Some are strong

One of these days
I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long
It won't be long


(Repeat 3x)
A            F#m
One of these days
A            F#m
One of these days
A            F#m
One of these days
       D
And it won't be long
   E
It won't be long
(End on A 3rd time)
