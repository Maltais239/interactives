Kathy's Song
Simon & Garfunkel
Key: G
Tempo: 96 BPM


lead vocal, one guitar

G               C
I hear the drizzle of the rain,
G     Am    Gsus   C/F#   D7/F#
like amemory it falls
G         D/F#     G     C
Soft and warm, continuing
 Am      Gsus   D          G
tapping on my roof and walls
G               C
And from the shelter of my mind,
G      Am  Gsus      C/F#    D7/F#
Through the window of my eyes
G       D/F#            G               C
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets,
       Am     D                 C G
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffuse
my thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep,
and kiss you when you start your day

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I
