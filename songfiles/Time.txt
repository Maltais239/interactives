Tempo: 96 BPM
                                           
Am                                        C
Tick-ing a-way the moments that make up a dull--day;
G                                            Am
frit-ter and waste the hours--in an off-hand way;
                                               C
Kick-ing a-round on a piece of ground--in your hometown;
G                                                    Am
wait-ing  for some-one or some-thing to show_you the way.
     
                         
Fmaj7                               Cmaj7
Tired of ly--ing in the sun--shine, stay-ing home--to watch the rain,
Fmaj7                              Cmaj7
you are young and life is long,and there is time to kill to-day.
Fmaj7                      Em7
And then one day,you find--ten years have got be-hind you.
Dm7                             G
 No one told you when to run....You missed the start--ing gun.
 

            Am                                              C
And you run  and you run-to catch up with the Sun, but it's sink-ing
G                                        Am
rac-ing a-round to come up be--hind you again.
                                                    C
The Sun is the same in a rel-a-tive way, but you're old-er,
G                                          Am
short-er of breath, and one-day clos-er to death.


Fmaj7                              Cmaj7
Ev--'ry year is get--ing short-er, nev-er seem to find the time.
Fmaj7                                 Cmaj7
Plans that ei-ther come to naught, or half a page of scrib-bled lines.
Fmaj7                         Em7                            Dm7
Hang-ing on in qui-et des--peration is the Eng-lish way. The time is gone.
                                           Dm7AbGm
The song is o--ver. Thought I'd some-thing  more to say.
