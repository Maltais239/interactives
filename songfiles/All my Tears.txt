All my Tears
Emmylou Harris
Bm
When I go don't cry for me
D              A        Bm
In my fathers arms I'll be
Bm
The wounds this world left on my soul
D                  A           Bm
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Bm
Sun and moon will be replaced
D        A         Bm
With the light of Jesus' face
Bm
And I will not be ashamed
D             A        Bm
For my savior knows my name
Bm
It don't matter where you bury me
D             A          Bm
I'll be home and I'll be free
Bm
It don't matter where I lay
Bm     A                Bm
All my tears be washed away
Bm
Gold and silver blind the eye
D      A         Bm
Temporary riches lie
Bm
Come and eat from heaven's store
D                  A         Bm
Come and drink and thirst no more
Bm
So weep not for me my friend
D            A          Bm
When my time below does end
Bm
For my life belongs to him
D              A           Bm
Who will raise the dead again
Bm
It don't matter where you bury me
D             A          Bm
I'll be home and I'll be free
Bm
It don't matter where I lay
Bm     A                Bm
All my tears be washed away
