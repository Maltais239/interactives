Dreams
Verse
Key: Am

C            D
Now here you go again you say you want your freedom
Em          D             C
well who am I to keep you down
Em          D                   C                  D
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
Em           D               C             D
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness


Pre-Chorus

C                         D
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
C                         D
In the stillness of remembering
C                      D
what you had
C                      D
and what you lost
C                      D
what you had
C                      D
and what you lost


Chorus

Em               D              C
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Em              D               C
Players only love you when they're playing
Em              D               C
women they will come and they will go
Em             D                 C
when the rain washes you clean you'll know

(repeat same chords as above for rest of song)


Verse

Em           D            C
Now here i go again i see the crystal vision
Em          D             C
i keep my visions to myself
Em          D                   C                  D
it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
Em           D               C             D
and have you any dreams you'd like to sell dreams of loneliness

and what you lost

what you had
C                      D
and what you lost
