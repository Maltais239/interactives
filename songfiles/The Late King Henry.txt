Key: D



Capo 2
         D                     Em
Well, we built this house on a web of lies
             G                       D
And when the walls fell in I came to realize
             D                         Bm
That if your love don't leave you then you're all right
    G                   D
And baby we've a-got it made

          D                         Bm
Well, the river rose up and came to me last night
             G
And took the hat right off of my head
           D                               Bm
You said, "Honey don't you let it push you on your back
        G                         D
Because honey, you've still got your age"

Chrous:
            D
Come on and save me
                         G
Take me to the river and bathe me
                           D
Just don't let nobody else claim me, honey
                         G
Take me to the river and name me
                      D
Tell me that it's all right


Well, the late King Henry came to me last night
Said you get your wings when you go straight
Well, no one on the river ever needed to fly
To lead their poor hearts astray

Come on and save me
Take me to the river and bathe me
Just don't let nobody else claim me, honey
Take me to the river and change me
Tell me that it's all right!

Yeah, tell me that it's all right!
