Verse

A             G        D
Johanna drove slowly into the city
A             G        D
The Hudson River all filled with snow
A             G        D
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
A6  A Asus4
Oh-oh-oh

A             G        D
A thousand years in one piece of silver
A             G        D
She took it from his lily-white hand
A             G        D
Showed no fear - she'd seen the thing
A6  A Asus4
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering

Chorus

D                                        G      D
(I usually hum the lead here, listen to the song and try it if you want)
D                                        G      D
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say OH


Verse

A             G        D
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
A             G        D
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
A             G        D
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
A6  A Asus4
Oh-oh-oh

A             G        D
I saw Johanna down in the subway
A             G        D
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
A             G        D
Half of the ring lies here with me
A6  A Asus4
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
