The Right Way
Darren Maltais
Key: G

    G     D    Em
The heart will lead
G      D         Em
out of this place
          G
Though we hope
          D
Though we hope
          Em
Though we hope
             C
it leads the right way

     G    D       Em
When dark fell on you
    G           D      Em     C
And covered you like a shroud
        G          D
Did you let go the reins
        Em
Let the dark fill your veins
           G    D   Em  C
Or did you live out loud

        G        D    Em
And the thoughts that stir
    G        D            Em    C
And fly like moths to the flame
    G           D           Em
And float there behind your unresting eyes
          G          D     Em
Will they find their peace again?

C
Who told you that lie
                     G
that time heals your wounds?
      C
there ain't no rest in your mind
                     D
when love leaves too soon

     G    D           Em
This room holds on to her
        G D       Em    C
in this vibrating space
G        D        Em
memories fly like ghosts in our minds
G                      D           Em
can't believe  that we got to this place

C
who told you that lie
              G
that you will forget
C
when you're alone
                                      D
there ain't nothing but you and those thoughts
running wild in your head

  G     D       Em
I won't see you again
  G     D         Em  C
Despite what they say
    G        D
I'm not satisfied
       Em
with a  passing goodbye
      G       D           Em
and a longing taking your place
