Am     C           G          Am
Better too soon or better too late
Am        C   G              Am
These are questions that I debate
Am        C            G      Am
The night is young and so are we
Am      C    G            Am
Let's unveil all we wanna see

Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight
Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight
Am           C            G          Am
I don't know if I feel or if I wanna know what's right
Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight

Am        C        G         Am
The heavy goblet's all night brew
Am         C                  G        Am
our hunger feeds on eyes that boil the stew
Am        C                 G          Am
let loose of the reigns and fall under thee
Am      C                 G             Am
it runs through her veins and it pushes she

Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight
Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight
Am           C            G          Am
I don't know if I feel or if I wanna know what's right
Am               C         G          Am
there's a little something in the air tonight
