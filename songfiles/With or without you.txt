  G         AmF
I wait for you

C           G                  Am
Sleight of hand and twist of fate,
              F                 C
on a bed of nails she makes me wait,
       G      Am           F
and I wait....withthout you

Through the storm we reach the shore,
             F              C
you give it all but I want more,
           G     Am     F
and I'm waiting for you

I can't live
            Am      F
with or without you


        C             G
And you give yourself away,
        Am            F
and you give yourself away,
        C             G
and you give, and you give,
        Am            F
and you give yourself away

C            G
My hands are tied,
Am      F
my body bruised, she's got me with,
C          G
nothing to win,
    Am              F
and nothing left to lose

        C             G
And you give yourself away,
        Am            F
and you give yourself away,
        C             G
and you give, and you give,
        Am            F
and you give yourself away


            C      G
With or without you
            Am     F
With or without you
        C   G
I can't live
            Am     F
With or without you
