Everywhere
Billy Bragg
Key: Bm



Bm  A  D           Bm  A     G
Dig in boys for an extended stay
                Bm   A  D             Bm   A   D
Those were the final orders to come down that day
 Bm        A    D           Bm  A   G Bm
Waiting to be saved in the Philippines
        A      D             Bm    A   D
You'll wait forever for the young Marines

Now I believe to be here is right
But I have to say that I'm scared tonight
Crouching in this hole with a mouth full of sand
What comes first, the country or the man
F#m                        G(barre)          D
Look at those slanted eyes coming up over the hill
 F#m                                G              A
Catching us by surprise, it's time to kill or be killed

chorus:
      D        G               D            G
Over here, over there, it's the same everywhere
        Bm         A         G             Bm   A       D
A boy cries out for his mother before he dies for his home
(same as above)
All my life I wanted to be
As clever and strong as my best friend Lee
We grew up together along half Moon Bay
Lee was Japanese, born in the USA
When Tommy was fighting Jerry along the River Seine
Me and Lee we wanted to do the same
Then they bombed Pearl Harbor at the break of day
I was headed for these islands when Lee was hauled away
They said look at his slanted eyes, he's guilty as guilty can be
Sent here as enemy spies to sabotage the Land of the Free
I never got home, my platoon was never saved
That little foxhole became my island grave
Lee got out of jail but a prisoner he remained
Till he ended his own life to lose that ball and chain
And they said, Oh Little Slanted Eyes can't you forgive and forget
And he said Oh Mr Friendly Ghost
Can you catch water in a net?
