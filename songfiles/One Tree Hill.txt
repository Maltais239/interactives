C5                           F5
We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
       Bb5             F5     C5        C7C5
As the day begs the night for mercy love
C5                               F5
The sun's so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars
Bb5         F5           C5           C7C5
carved into stone on the face of earth
C5                      F5
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
           Bb5    F5           C5
We see the sun go down in your eyes

             Bb   F         C5
You run like river in like a sea
               Bb   F              C5
you run like a river runs to the sea

C5                          F5
And in the world a heart of darkness, a firezone
      Bb5               F5           C5
Where poets speak their hearts, then bleed for it
C5                    F5
Jara sang, his song a weapon, in the hands of love
             Bb5         F5             C5
You know his blood still cries from the ground

             Bb   F         C5
You run like river in like a sea
               Bb   F              C5
you run like a river runs to the sea


C                          F
I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
      Bb5                  F/C          C
while bullets rape the night of the merciful
                             F
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
        Bb5                F/C      C
and the moon has turned red over one tree hill


C        F/C    Bb5       F/C
Oh great ocean, old great sea
C          F      Bb5 F/C    C
run to the ocean, run to the sea.
