C
Got that weight, we never put it down
But sometimes people help us carry it around
F
Carry it around
C
Carry it around

C
Love is a spark, I don't think it dies
But it’s got its seasons and sometimes it hides
F
Sometimes it hides
C
Sometimes it hides

G
Why don’t you take this for a while
I’m feeling that weight
F
Can’t put it down
                          C
But can you take it for a day?


There’s the shape of you I’m missing every day
Shadows in the leaves remind of your face
Remind me of your face
Remind me of your face

Can you take this for a while?
I’m feeling that weight
Can’t put it down
But can you take it for a day?

Got that weight, we never put it down
But sometimes people help us carry it around
never put it down

Why don’t you take this for a while
I’m feeling that weight
never put it down
But can you take it for a day

We never put it down
