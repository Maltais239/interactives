Key: G
Tempo: 96 BPM

G    C(Guitar2throughout)
        

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Feel, feel it grow
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
In your mind
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
In your mind

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Life is how you live it
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Through time
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Through time
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
And there’s no desert sun
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
That is hot enough to feed your fire
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
We shipwreck like fools
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Only to become the ocean’s choir

D
And the sun dies until it’s reborn
D
But there’s no road that ain’t a hard road to travel on

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Got lost on the way but you found the road again
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Stay true to your friends cause they’ll save you in the end

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
There must be something in the air, in the air
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Some kind of answer to my prayers, to my prayers
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
Some kind of answer to my prayers

D
I’ve been dying since the day I was born
D
Cause there’s no road that ain’t a hard road to travel on


Em D Bm D C
I have a vision in my mind
Of a life that I’ve left behind

G    D   Em9   Bm   D
And can’t you see that lost souls can’t swim
You know you’ll sink but you still jump in

G    D   Em9   Bm   C
And it’s alright to get caught
Stealing back what you’ve lost

G    D   Em9   Bm    D
Yeah don’t you know that lost souls can’t swim
You beat them back or they drag you in

D
And I can’t say that I am sorry for all my many sins

Solo: Coming Soon.

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
And you try to find a love that’ll see you through your darkest days
G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
And her soft brown hair is as long as the Canadian highway

D
And the sun dies until it’s reborn
But there’s no road that ain’t a hard road to travel on

G G  Cadd9Cadd9
       

D
Been dying since the day I was born
Cause there’s no road that ain’t a hard road to travel on

G G  Cadd9Cadd9
       

G  G   Cadd9  Cadd9
There must be something in the air, in the air x4

Fade out...
