SUGAR DADDY

CH ( D C# F#m)
You’re my Sugar daddy and I’m your baby
I see your eyes wandering won’t you come back to me
I know I’m yours I share your drawers
You’ve got so many keys
Who’s behind the doors?
When we first met, I played hard to get
You had the looks, the charm and you got me out of debt
CH
I caught ya lookin’ all this time you’re booking time off
And away from me, tell me who’s this girl you been cooking
What does she got, that I ain’t been taught
If she’s your EX-clamation baby then I ain’t your dot!

If all this is true, then we are thru! I’ll grab my pistol and shoot right at you
Outro
You were my sugar daddy but you gave me a cavity
Rotted out my heart and now it’s bang bang and bye bye to thee
