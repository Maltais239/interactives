Them Kids
Sam Roberts
Key: C

Notes: the song sounds best when played with barre chords


       C                                             G
No one feels more alone that the children of a dying breed
          C                                              G
You never feel at home when you're just another mouth to feed
C                               G
    I wanna live in geological time
            C                         G
Because I'm still in my biological prime

F                                     C
  If nobody listens, then who's gonna hear?
F                         C      Dm
  If nobody listens, will we disappear?


           C                                     G
You flip a man a quarter playing songs on his guitar
            C                                           G
You're on a street corner, feeling like a patron of the arts
            C                                           G
And now the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
           C                                           G
I said the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll


F                                     C
  If nobody listens, then who's gonna hear?
F                         C      Dm
  If nobody listens, will we disappear?


                                C                                           G
I just don't understand why the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
           C                                           G
I said the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
        C                                                    G
They're always on the phone and they always gotta have control
            C                                           G
And now the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll


F            Dm                C
  The golden years are under attack (we're taking them back, we're taking them back)
F            Dm                C
  The golden years are under attack (we're taking them back, we're taking them back)
F                 Dm                    C
  Looking for an original voice but the beaten path leaves little choice
F                     Dm                C                                         Dm  F
  The melody that you thought you found reveals that she's been sleeping around


C
 We were apostles, they were the high priests
G                                                   &lt;--played higher on the neck--
 We lived the hustle, the keepers of the backbeat
C
 We're under pressure to reconcile
G                                            &lt;--played higher on the neck--
 Our point of view with contemporary style



           C                                                    G    F
It used to be that the kids were the ones who knew how to get off
         C                                                      G    F
It was a yell from the swamp, now it's only coming out as a cough
        C                                              G
I can't sell my songs so I'm gonna have to give 'em away
        C                                               G
I can't sell myself since my hair started turning to grey


F                                     C
  If nobody listens, then who's gonna hear?
F                         C      Dm
  If nobody listens, will we disappear?


                                C                                           G
I just don't understand why the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
           C                                           G
I said the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
         C                                                G
The high priests are calling all disciples back to the fold
            C                                           G
Because the kids don't know how to dance to rock and roll
