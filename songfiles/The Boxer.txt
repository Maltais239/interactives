C                                      Em/B   Am
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7             G                 C
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
             Am            G                 F
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C    GFEmC
And disregards the rest

       C                                         Em/B   Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
       G
In the company of strangers
       G7         G                C
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Am           G              F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                        C
Where the ragged people go
        G              F    G          C
Looking for the places only they would know


       Am          G                                Am
Lie la lie, Lie la la la la la lie lala lie, Lie la lie,
       F             G                   C
Lie la  lie la la la la, lie la la la la lie.


       C                                   Em/B  Am
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
       G7               G                 C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
       Am                G                F
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                    C
I took some comfort there
G                  FEmC
Lie lie lie lie la

         C                                        Em/B  Am
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
      G                 G7                           C           Am
Going home... where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
        Em Am     G
Leading me, going home.

       C                                     Em/B   Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
       G                           G7
And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down
   C                                              Am
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
     G             F
I am leaving, I am leaving
                        C
But the fighter still remains
 G                  FEmC
(Lie lie lie lie la   ..again if you want.
