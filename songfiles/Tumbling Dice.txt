Tumbling Dice
Rolling Stones
Key: D



   D
Women think I'm tasty but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
    A  D  A  D   G                             A
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown
Cos all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin like I don't know how
But baby, baby, there's fever in the funkhouse now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet aitchin'
You know, you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, I can't stay
            G
You got to roll me
      A                   D
And call me the tumbling dice
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Do you see the time flashing by
Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes, sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
But baby, I can't stay
             G           A
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
 G           A                     D
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' in the field every night
Baby, can't stay
              G          A
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
  G          A                     D
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
         G  D
Got to roll me
         G  D
Got to roll me ...
