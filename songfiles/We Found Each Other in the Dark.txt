We Found Each Other in the Dark
City and Colour
Key: C

Intro:

  C/D                   Fmaj7 C/D
I heard the church bells from afar
    Am  G          Fmaj7        C/D
But we  found each other in the dark.
Fmaj7 C/D                 Fmaj7   C/D
 and  when the smoke does finally pass,
Am      G    Fmaj7         C/D
We will rise above all the ash.

Chorus:
      Am                G                Fmaj7
Cause we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
Am                G                Fmaj7
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
Am                G                Fmaj7                C/D
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live at last.


Verse 2:

Fmaj7 C/D                       Fmaj7  C/D
So    Bright, the flames burned in our hearts
     Am G          Fmaj7        C/D
That we found each other in the dark.
Fmaj7 C/D               Fmaj7  C/D
Like  Beast, out in the wilder ness
       Am       G  Fmaj7          C/D
We are fighting to survive and convalesce.




Chorus:
      Am                G                Fmaj7
Cause we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
Am                G                Fmaj7
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
Am                G                Fmaj7                     C/D
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live like the rest.

Keep playing C/D and Fmaj7, If you listen to the song you'll get the beat on how Dallas plays it.


Bridge:
Am                               C/D
Through the black starless water
C/D                     Am
And the cold lonely air
Am                        C/D
On the rough restless sea
C/D                          Am
The vessel in deep disrepair
Am                                 C/D
And our swans they started singing
C/D     Fmaj7 Esus4  G
But then oh    re..  joice
G                     Fmaj7
I can still hear your voice


Outro:
  C/D                   Fmaj7 C/D
I heard the church bells from afar
    Am  G          Fmaj7        C/D
But we  found each other in the dark.
