I SAW HER STANDING THERE     THE BEATLES
             D7                     G7          D7
Well she was just seventeen and you know what I mean
                                      A7
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
   D           D7           G7    A#7
So how could I dance with another oh,
       D7      A7       D7
when I saw her standing there
     D7                      G7      D7
Well she looked at me and I, I could see
                                           A7
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
D            D7           G7
She wouldn't dance with another
A#7         D7      A7       D7
Oh,  when I saw her standing there
        G7
Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
                       A7  G7
and I held her hand in mine
        D7
Well we danced through the night
       G7              D7
and we held each other tight
                                        A7
And before too long I fell in love with her
    D          D7         G7
Now I'll never dance with another
A#7       D6        A7       D7
Oh, since I saw her standing there
D7              A7       D7
Since I saw her standing there
D7                 D7      A7       D7
Yeah, Well since I saw her standing there
