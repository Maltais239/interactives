Marie Stone
Joël Lavoie
Key: A
Tempo: 96 BPM

A
Bare feet on cold concrete
                                F#m
Still wet from the soft morning rain
E
Walking away from that dead end street
D
Before the dark clouds roll in again

A
She wants to have another taste
                                 F#m
Another rush of the bitter sweet high
E
She use to do anything for a hit
D
She didnt care if it made you cry

Marie Stone loves her grandma
Her strong hands, her healing touch
The ones she held when her daddy ran away
And mommy, well she drinks too much

Marie Stone sits on the beach
Watching the waves rolling and tumbling
The red sun sinks like a heart of stone
She doesnt feel anything

F                                                      E
Peace like a warrior wind moves across the newborn sky
Unseen and forever shifting, right there in front of your eyes
Right there in front of your eyes
harp
Solo

Marie Stone loves her grandma
Her warm hugs, her deep gray eyes
A woman as wise as the forest green
And as sweet as her Saskatoon pies

She said: Nothing is forever
Even the moon that shines above
There will come a day when
Youll stop running away

She said: Nothing is forever
Even the moon and stars above
There will come a day my sweet darling
When well all stop running away
Running away from Love
Running away from Love
