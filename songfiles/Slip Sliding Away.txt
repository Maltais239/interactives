Slip Sliding Away
Paul Simon
Key: G



 G                             Em
Slip slidin away Slip slidin away
               G                D
You know the nearer your destination
    C                D         G
The more you're slip slidin  away

         Em                  G
I know a man He came from my home town
             C               D
He wore his passion for his woman
       C            C7
Like a thorny crown
         G
He said Delores
            Em               G            D
I live in fear  My love for you is so overpowering
   C           D          G
I'm afraid that I will disappear

               G               Em
Slip slidin away Slip slidin away
                G                D
You know the nearer your destination
    C                D       G
The more you're slip slidin away

          Em               G
I know a woman Became a wife
               C              D
These are the very words she uses
      C               C7
To describe her life;

           G
She said a good day
             Em
Ain't got no rain
           G                D
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
    C        D                      G
And think of things that might have been

               G               Em
Slip slidin away Slip slidin away
               G                D
You know the nearer your destination
     C                 D      G
The more you're slip slidin away

              Em         D     G
And I know a father Who had a son
              C                D
He longed to tell him all the reasons
        C                  C7
For the things he'd done;

             G             Em
He came a long way Just to explain
              G             D
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
        C                 D           G
Then he turned around and headed home again

               G               Em
Slip slidin away Slip slidin away
              G                D
You know the nearer your destination
     C                D       G
The more you're slip slidin away

          Em                   G
God only knows God makes his plan
         C           D
The information's unavailable
       C           C7
To the mortal man;

           G                  Em
We work our jobs Collect our pay
               G                D
Believe we're gliding down the highway
        C               D        G
When in fact we're slip slidin away

               G                 Em
Slip slidin away Slip slidin away
               G                D
You know the nearer your destination

    C                D        G
The more you're slip slidin away
Slip slidin away

              G                D
You know the nearer your destination

    C                D      G
The more you're slip slidin away
