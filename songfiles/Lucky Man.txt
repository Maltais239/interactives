Tab for Lucky Man (Urban Hymns, Track9). Tabbed by Simon McCarthy
Another great track from the best album of all time (in my opinion), although lead guitarist / god-like figure Nick McCabe doesn't play much of the song. The lead is mostly played by rhythm guitarist Simon Tong. The lead is played clean with compression and delay (The slightest bit of drive may help) and the ambient guitar noises are mostly clean as well.
Tuning: Standard
Scale: G bluescale
Capo: None
Guitar: Lead- Gibson ES355, other- Gibson Les Paul Goldtop / Fender Strat
Effects: Boss Compressor, Watkins Copycat Tape Echo, Alesis Quadraverb, Boss Digital Delay, Marshall Drivemaster, Roland Frequency Cleaner.

Chords:
G= 320002 / 355433
D= xx0232 / 101212111010
Dsus= xx0230
Asus4= 002200
Em= 022000
Intro (6 Bars)- Acoustic -
G D Dsus Asus4
                (Acoustic plays this throughout verses and chorus as well)
Distort electric plays chords as well.
Nicks guitars play these-






Main lick:






Bar4:






All the bars are filled up with sustained notes of chords with the pickup selector switch being moved back and forward with one pickups volume lower that the other. This ambient noise continues throughout the whole song.
Verse-
Happiness, more or less,
It's just a change in me something in my liberty,
oh,oh, my my   (Main Lick)
Happiness coming and going,
I watch you look at me, watch my fever grow, and I know,
Just where I am.
Bridge- Em G D Dsus Asus4 (Distort guitar plays arpeggios)
Well how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind
Lick2-






(Played on the Asus4 chord of the chorus and bridge)
Chorus- G D Dsus Asus4
Cos I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hand
Verse2
Happiness, something in my own place,
I'm stood here naked, smiling, I feel no disgrace,
With who I am.
Bridge repeats
Chorus
I hope you understand (Solo Starts here)
I hope you understand (After this heavy distortchords provide rhythm)
Solo-






etc..
Heavy distort chords-






This continues until a middle break (approx. 3mins 38) where the drums, orchestra and bass cut out returning to the acoustic guitar and the electric overdubs. One electric plays this using the pickup selector switch as before-






Another electric plays this over the break constantly repeating until the end of the song-






Then after the four bar break the heavy chords return again with the rest of the band and the song ends about half a minute later.
