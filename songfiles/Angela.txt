Verse

         G                         Dm
When you left this town, with your windows down
        C
And the wilderness inside
        G                   Dm
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
         C
'Til the road and sky align

Chorus

    G                 Dm
The strangers in this town,
     C                    Am
They raise you up just to cut you down
   G             Dm             C
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Verse

         G                   Dm
And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
         C
With the cities on the signs
        G                        Dm
But you held your course to some distant war
       C
In the corners of your mind

Chorus

         G             Dm
From the second time around
    C           Am
The only love I ever found
   G             Dm             C
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Break

    G       C  Em

Verse

         G                     Dm
Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
          C
With your fingers in a fist
        G                         Dm
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
       C
In the radio abyss?

Chorus II

G                 Dm
Strangers in this town,
     C                    Am
They raise you up just to cut you down
   G             Dm             C      Am
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
   G                 Dm                 C
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

End

    G          Dm            C           Am
Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
    G         Dm         C         Am
Angela, on my knees, I belong, I believe
