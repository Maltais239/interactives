Capo 4


Verse 1

Em           B
You were my sun
C            Am
You were my earth
Em              B                  C            Am
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
Em              B
So you took a chance
C               Am
And made other plans
Em                    B                           C              Am
But I bet you didn't think your thing would come crashing down, no
Em                  B
You don't have to say, what you did,
  C              Am
I already know, I found out from him
Em                              B                    C
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
    Am                      Em
And don't it make you sad about it


Chorus
                B
You told me you loved me
            C               Am
Why did you leave me, all alone
Em                   B
Now you tell me you need me
         C                 Am
When you call me, on the phone
Em          B                      C
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
                 Am
With some other guy
Em                   B                      C
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
    Am            Em      B
To cry, cry me a river
          C        Am
Cry me a river-er
          Em     B
Cry me a river
          C        Am
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

Verse 2
Em                B
I know that they say
                    C             Am
That somethings are better left unsaid
Em          B             C                     Am
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
Em           B
All of these things people told me
     C               Am
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
Em                   B
You should've picked honesty
     C                    Am
Then you may not have blown it
(Yea..)

Em                     B
You don't have to say, what you did,
(Don't have to say, what you did)
  C               Am
I already know, I found out from him
(I already know, uh)
Em                              B                    C
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
    Am                      Em
And don't it make you sad about it

Why did you leave me, all alone
(All alone)
Em                  B
Now you tell me you need me
         C               Am
When you call me, on the phone
(When you call me on the phone)
Em       B                         C
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
                Am
With some other guy
(I'm not like them baby)
Em                B                         C
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
(It's your turn)
   Am
To cry
