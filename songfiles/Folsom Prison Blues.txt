I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend
                                    F7
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    Bb                                             F
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
         C7                                     F
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son
                            F7
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns"
      Bb                                    F
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       C7                                            F
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folk eatin' in a fancy dinin' car
                                    F7
They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
      Bb                                      F
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
          C7                                             F
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                               F7
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Bb                                               F
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I'd want to stay
        C7                                      F
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
