Am        G             F
I'm so lonely, feeling heavy love

You're just so far from where I want you now

Come on now, baby

They'll keep you wavering

Until you've reached some modern low

It's not just lazy

It can't always be this heavy love
Am             G                     F
We'll have to wear our fears so everyone
G
Can see it too
