A fire

Am        G/B        C                Fmaj7
Poised on the edge of your heart and mine
Em                                Am
Keep your eyes wide open look for the sign
Am        G/B        C                Fmaj7
Your whole goddamn world may be falling apart
Em                                E7
But in the end all you need is good place to start
