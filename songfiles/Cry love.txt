Cry love

Key: F



  F         C           G        Am
A moment of steel(?); a dry-eyed house
    F          C                     G        Am
Did he say goodbye to you or did you kick him out?
I know you're not afraid to go alone
But this was a marriage of spirit, flesh, and bone
Now whatcha gonna do when the planet shifts?
Whatcha gonna do - gonna slit your wrists?
And bleed all over the milky way
The stars in your eyes look red today
Cry love, Cry love
The tears of an angel, the tears of a dove
Spill it all over your heart from above
Cry Love, Cry Love
<mandolin break>
The trust of a woman in his hand
But he was a little boy and not a man
You loved him stronger than he could feel
Yeah he was wrapped up in himself like an orange peel
Now whatcha gonna do with the booze and the blush?
Whatcha gonna do when there's no rush?
Cop a little misery at the corner store
Well one day that train of pain will stop no more
<Chorus>
<mandolin break>
Thrown like a blanket(?) on the floor
If this is a lesson in love then what's it for?
The heart will remember the burning fire
The next time you feel the flame of desire
<Chorus>  x2
.........
