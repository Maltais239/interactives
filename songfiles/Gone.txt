I awoke and the ideas left
Fleeing like fish back into the depths
Gone where they came from the abyss
And all that I had left was this sensation

I suffered when you first left
Felt like a limb that's no longer there
All my life was up in the air
And all that I had left was this sensation

A                   E
All you thought you had
A                   E
All you thought you were
E                   E
All you thought you knew
A
Gone
hold A

I feel like I'm drowning lying in bed
The sheets like waves going over my head
One of those dreams that we all dread
If only I could come up for air

Lights splash when the cars race by
On the ceiling and walls they break up the night
And the shapes they make play on behind my eyes

All you thought you had
All you thought you were
All you thought you knew
Gone
hold A

Little did I know what the result would be
Bobbing and floating like I'm on the sea
Left with just these thought of you and me
And this sensation

All you thought you had
All you thought you were
All you thought you knew
Gone
hold A
