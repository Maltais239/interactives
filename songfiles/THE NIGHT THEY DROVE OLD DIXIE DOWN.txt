     Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train,

Am                 C/G              F           F/E     Dm
     'Til Stoneman's Calvery came and tore up the tracks again.

Am/E                F            C            Dm
     In the winter of '65, We were hungry, just barely alive.

Am/E                 F                             C    Dm            D
     By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well,


(Chorus)

    C/G          Fmaj7         C/G           Fmaj7
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the bells were ringing,

    C/G        Fmaj7           C/G           Fmaj7
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the people were singin'.  They went

C/G          Am              Gsus4                   F             C
La,  La, La, La, La, La,     La, La, La, La, La, La,    La, La,


Am                   C               F           F/E       Dm
  Back with my wife in Tennessee, When one day she called to me,

Am       C                F          F/E       Dm
  "Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!"

Am/E             F                    C                 Dm
  Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good.

Am/E                        F
  Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,

       C                 Dm             D
But they never should have taken the very best.     (Chorus)


Am               C        F      F/E      Dm
  Like my father before me, I will work the land,

Am              C         F          F/E   Dm
  Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.

Am/E                  F                 C                     Dm
  He was just eighteen, proud and brave,  But a Yankee laid him in his grave,

Am/E                 F
  I swear by the mud below my feet,

  C                        Dm                D
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat.    (Chorus and fade)

THE WEIGHT
(The Band)
G             Bm            C                       G      C    G
I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead;

       Bm                    C            G      C      G
I just need some place where I can lay my head.

                      Bm              C                G       C     G
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"

                    Bm                  C                G      C      G
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.


(Chorus)
       D       C      G      D         G
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free;

       D        C                                                    G
Take a load off Fanny, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.

G(F#bass        Em       Em7       C
                                   

G              Bm          C                      G       C     G
I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;

G          Bm                   C               G      C      G
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.

              Bm           C                G      C      G
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."

           Bm                 C                 G       C       G
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around."

(Chorus)

              Bm             C               G       C       G
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say

              Bm               C                    G      C      G
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on Judgement Day.

                Bm            C               G      C      G
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"

                  Bm                 C                      G        C      G
He said, "Do me a favor, son, woncha stay and keep Anna Lee company?"


(Chorus)

              Bm                  C                G      C      G
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog.

                 Bm                C                    G      C      G
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."

                        Bm                C              G      C      G
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."

          Bm                          C                 G      C      G
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."


(Chorus)

        Bm                  C                G      C      G
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line

          Bm                C               G      C      G
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time.

                    Bm              C              G      C      G
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one.

            Bm              C              G      C      G
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.


(Chorus)
