She said, If you have money love, you can buy me that ring
                                                               C#
If you don't have a thing, you can bring me the corner of your mouth

C#                                             G#
If you have sadness love, spill it in front of me
                                                              C#
I'll gather up the drops that fall and hide them so you never see

Retrace, retrace following the lines
F#                                   C#
Back to the place where they meet in time
F#                                        C#
The scattered threads leading back to the loom
F#                                 C#                 G#
To the point where paths part that brought us to this room

C#                                            G#
If you have worries love, lay them down at my feet
                                                        C#
I'll burn them up at the alter and they'll be safe with me

C#                                        G#
If you have music love, let it ring in my ears
                                            C#
Magically, you will see the beautiful words appear

If you have beauty love, share it with me
                                                                     C#
I'll take it in and make it grow and give back more than you gave to me

C#                                          G#
If you have darkness love, covering up your eyes
                                                                        C#
I'll light the flame that will make it flee and together we'll watch it rise
