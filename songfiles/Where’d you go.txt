Where'd you go x 4
    C                        D       G
You used to be the pillar on which I stood

Flyin’ low x4
You used to be an angel, now you ain’t no good

C                  G
It’s some peculiar thing
C              G
Eclipsing ev’rything

Did you know? X4
You got a hold that won’t let go

Take it slow x4
Breakin’ hearts is a business that you were made for

It’s some peculiar thing
Eclipsing ev’rything
EmD          C
You With a heart that’s been hardened by pressure and time
EmD         C                                        G
You Let’s hope that there’s a diamond down in that mine

I’m gonna go x4
Ain’t no reason for me to stay

You broke the mold x4
Ain’t nobody made in that same way

It’s some peculiar thing
Eclipsing ev’rything
You. With a heart that’s been hardened by pressure and time
You. Let’s hope that there’s a diamond down in that mine
In that mine
In that mine
