Thunder Road
Bruce Springsteen
Key: C



C                   F      C
Screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
                       G                      F
Like a vision dancing across the porch as the radio plays
                             C-G               C                  F
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely, hey that's me  and I want you only
                               C                     G
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again

      C                        F                      C
Don't run back inside, darlin, you know just what I'm here for
                                          G
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that
F
young any more
                                          C-G
show a little faith, there's magic in the night
            C                        F
You ain't a beauty but hey, you're alright
       C                   G
Oh and that's alright with me

        C                           Am
You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
     C                            F
Make crosses of your lovers throw roses in the rain
C                  G
Waste your summers praying in vain
      F                         G
For a savior to rise from these streets
         C                  Am
Well now I'm no hero that's understood
          C                            F
All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
C                     G                F                   G
With a chance to make real somehow hey what else can we do now except
C                         F                 C
Roll down the windows and let the wind blow back your hair
                                    G                      F
Well the night's busting open these two lanes will take us anywhere
                                  C-G
We got one last chance to make it real
   C                            F
To trade in these wings on some wheels
               C                    G
Climb in back  Heavens waiting down on the track


C         Am                C                      F
Ohh come take my hand  We're ridin out tonight to case the Promised Land
C     G            F                G
Oh Thunder Road, Oh Thunder road, Oh Thunder Road
C                         Am
Lyin' out there like a killer in the sun
C                            F
Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run
C    G               F           G            C
Oh Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

     F                         G                    C  CCFFCFC
So I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
       Am                                           F    G
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
            F                      G
From your front porch to my front seat
       C                       F
Door's open but the ride ain't free
     F
Well I know you've been lookin for words that I ain't spoken
     G
Well tonight we'll be free--all the promises will be broken

           C                     F                C
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
                                        G
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of
F
burned-out Chevrolets
                                      C-G
They scream your name at night in the street
                C                          F
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
           Em                                     F
And in the lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on
        Dm                G                   F                  Dm
Til you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind so Mary climb in
       F                             G                      C
It's a town full of losers and we're pulling out of here to win
