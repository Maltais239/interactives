The Harder They Come
Jimmy Cliff
Key: G




           G
Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
F
Waiting for me when I die
        G
But between the day you're born and when you die
       F
They never seem to hear even your cry

CHORUS:
       E
So as sure as the sun will shine
           Am
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
               G                    F                          C
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all
         G                     F                          C
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall, one and all

Well the officers are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done
CHORUS
ooh yeah    oh yeah    woh yeah   ooooh
C G  F G    C G F       C G F G    CGF
                                    
And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave
CHORUS
            G                    F                          C
Yeah, the harder they come, the harder they'll fall one and all
                               G    F    C   G   F   C
What I say now, what I say now        awww
What I say now, what I say one time
      G                    F                          C
The harder they come the harder they'll fall one and all
          G                    F                           D
Ooh the harder they come the harder they'll fall one and all
