Verse


C
Last night she said
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
        G
Oh, and turned me off
        Em        Dm
When I feel left out
   C
So I, I turned around
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I don't care no more
       G
I know this for sure
       Em              Dm
I'm walking out that door

C
Well, I've been in town
C
For just about fifteen minutes now
            Dm
Oh, Baby, I feel so down
      G
And I don't know why
        Em           Dm
I keep walking for miles


Chorus


 F                        G
But the people they don't understand
 F                          G
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
 F                         G
Your grandsons, they won't understand
 F                                G
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand

         G
It was a great big lie
      Em           Dm
As I left that night, yeah

Oh, people they don't understand
    F                       G
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
    F                     G
In spaceships, they won't understand
    F                      G
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand
