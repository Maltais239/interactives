Verse 1
Em7                                    A9
   She packed my bags last night - pre-flight
Em7                A9
   Zero hour, nine A.M.
C                  G/B     Am    Am/G              D/F#   D
  And I'm gonna be high -i-high       as a kite by then
Em7                            A9
   I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Em7                   A9
   It's lonely out in space                                   ^ ^
C           G/B     Am             Am/G    D/F#   D/A   D     C
  On such a ti - i -imeless flight


Chorus
G                                      C
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        G
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           G/B       A9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                   G           C
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

G                                      C
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        G
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           G/B       A9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                   G           C

   Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids

    In fact it's cold as hell
C                     G/B      Am         Am/G         D/F#   D/A   D

Em7                                     A9
    And all this science, I don't under stand
Em7                              A9
    It's just my job five days a week
