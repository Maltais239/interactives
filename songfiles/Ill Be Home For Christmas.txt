Ill Be Home For Christmas
Bing Crosby
Key: G


Bing Crosby version:

G       A7       D7
I'll be home for Christmas,
G       E7      Am
You can plan on me
C           D7        G     Em
Please have snow, and mistletoe,
    A7       Am     D7
and presents on the tree

G         A7       D7
Christmas Eve will find me,
G         E7         Am
Where the love light gleams
C       Cm       G     E7
I'll be home for Christmas,
   A7   D7  Am G
If only in  my dreams

Set8
