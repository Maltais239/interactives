The Collector

Key: C

    C                  F                 C
And in those days When all the light had gone away
F                       C
She wandered around her living room
G
Collecting tears on glass plates

    C            F         C
And under lights she would magnify
F                C
Crystal patterns floating by
G
Making art each time she cried

E F        C
Whoa there is a light
      E         F        C
She’s trying to catch it if she might
    E              F
And save it in her collection
    G
For later when it’s dark

And she’d travel deep
Down the path where memory sleeps
The forest where the wild things meet
And in the woods she found some peace

Time went on
Roses die while lilies bloom
Inside the four walls of that room
She hoped that she could walk free soon

Ooh there is a light
Catch it as the canvas dries
And save it in her collection
For later when it’s dark

Inward she’d roam
Way inside to find her home
She found her way there all alone
Was it ever really gone?

How many can say that we really tried
With all of us preoccupied
To catch the light before it flies?

Whoa there is a light
She’ll catch it if she times it right
they said that it would stay this time
To save in her collection
For later when it’s dark
