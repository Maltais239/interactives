  Asus2                      Em                      G             D              Asus2
The legend lives on from the chippewa on down of the Big lake they called "Gitche Gumee"
                             Em
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
         G          D           Asus2
When the skies of November turn gloomy.
                                   Em
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
         G          D              Asus2
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.
                              Em
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
         G           D            Asus2
When the "Gales of November" came early.


  Asus2                       Em
The ship was the pride of the American side
   G                  D          Asus2
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
                                 Em
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
       G             D            Asus2
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
                             Em
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
     G               D          Asus2
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
                              Em
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
      G               D                Asus2
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?


  Asus2                      Em
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
   G             D        Asus2
And a wave broke over the railing
                           Em
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
     G             D             Asus2
T'was the witch of November come stealin'.
                           Em
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
    G             D             Asus2
When the Gales of November came slashin'.
                           Em
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
      G          D              Asus2
In the face of a hurricane west wind.


  Asus2                       Em
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'.
G                 D        Asus2
"Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya."
                     Em
At Seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in', he said
G             D                Asus2
"Fellas, it's been good t'know ya"
                            Em
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
   G                  D           Asus2
And the good ship and crew was in peril.
                              Em
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
G                     D      Asus2
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.


  Asus2                     Em
Does any one know where the love of God goes
G                       D          Asus2
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
                                 Em
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
G                     D                 Asus2
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.
                                 Em
They might have split up or they might have capsized;
G              D             Asus2
May have broke deep and took water.
                            Em
And all that remains is the faces and the names
G                    D            Asus2
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.


  Asus2                    Em
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
G                   D         Asus2
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion.
                           Em
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
G               D            Asus2
The islands and bays are for sportsmen.
                       Em
And farther below Lake Ontario
G                  D             Asus2
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,
                             Em
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
G                 D        Asus2
With the Gales of November remembered.


  Asus2                Em
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
G                D        Asus2
In the "Maritime Sailors' Cathedral."
                                    Em
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
G                   D      Asus2
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.
                             Em
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
G                    D            Asus2
Of the big lake they call "Gitche Gumee".
                              Em
"Superior", they said, "never gives up her dead
G                  D              Asus2
When the 'Gales of November' come early!"

The Full Lyrics (thanks to Brian Ross)
===============


Once again, a hundred thousand *MORE* apologies to Brian Ross who obviously spent a long time on this -- heck, it's still worth getting just for the great lyric chart alone!!!  Also, apologies to those who were confused by my post. I'll be more careful!  It's just that, played "correctly" :^), this song sounds so eerie, that you can give yourself goose bumps.  It's even worth buying a 12-string JUST TO PLAY THIS SONG!
P.S. Any big GL fans?  I'd still love to hear from you!
