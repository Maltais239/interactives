Intro

Ab
Picturing you is all can do
            Db
Where’d you go babe
Ab
Can’t look ahead when you led
          Db
Me down a deadend

Eb
Damn damn damn
                     Db
Why’d I listen to my heart
    Eb
I’d stand stand stand
chorus?
                       Db
But my feet they can’t walk
               Ab
Walk away from you

Ab
Can’t break the spell and wish you well
           Db
I want you here babe
Ab
I know that we had our time in the sun
        Db
Kissing slowly

Eb
Damn damn damn
                     Db
Why’d I listen to my heart
    Eb
I’d stand stand stand
                       Db
But my feet they can’t walk
               Ab
Walk away from you

Ab
Time’s all we got and it ain’t a lot
             Db
So let’s not waste it
Ab
Stand at the door like you been here before
              Db
But you can’t place it

Eb
Damn damn damn
                     Db
Why’d I listen to my heart
    Eb
I’d stand stand stand
                       Db
But my feet they can’t walk
               Ab
Walk away from you

		    Ab
Walk away from you
Walk away from you
