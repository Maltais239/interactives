VERSE 1:

A                    G
Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune,

D                        A      lick
Something to make us all happy.

A                    G
Do anything, take us out of this gloom,

D                          A      lick
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.


VERSE 2:

A                       G
You are the one who can make us all laugh,

D                            A      lick
But doing that, you break out in tears.

A                                G
Please don't be sad, if it was a straight mind you had,

   D                                 A
We wouldn't have known you all these years.
