Fiddlers Green
Tragically Hip
Key: D



Capo 2nd fret
               D
September seventeen
                      G
To a girl I know it's mothers day
                 D
Her son has gone alee
                         A
And that's where he will stay
                   D
Wind on the weathervane
                  G
Tearing blue eyes sailor mean
                    D
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain
C                      D
For a boy on Fiddler's Green

                 D
His tiny knotted heart
                      G
Well I guess it never worked too good
                 D
The timber tore apart
                         A
And the water gorged the wood
                           D
You can hear her whispered prayer
                       G
For men at masts that always lean
                             D
The same wind that moves her hair
C                               D
Moves her boy through Fiddler's Green

A                    G
                     
Oh, nothing's changed anyway
    A                    G
Oh, nothing's changed anyway
    A       D
Anytime today

                  D
He doesn't know a soul
                              G
And there's nowhere that he's really been
                     D
But he won't travel long alone
                    A
No not on Fiddler's Green
                         D
Balloons all filled with rain
                        G
As children's eyes turn sleepy mean
                        D
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain
C                      D
For a boy on Fiddler's Green
