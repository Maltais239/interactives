When your baby leaves you all alone
      A                     E
And nobody calls you on the phone
                 B7
Doncha feel like crying?
                 E
Doncha feel like crying?
                B7                       E
Well, here I'am honey, c'mon, you cry to me

E
When you're all alone in your lonely room
            A                               E
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
                 B7
Doncha feel like crying?
                 E
Doncha feel like crying?
                   B7                               E  E7
Don't ya feel like crying, c'mon, c'mon, you cry to me

        A                            E
Woa oh, nothing can be sadder than a glass of wine alone
B7                                          E   E7
Loneliness loneliness, such a waste of your time
        A                                 E
But you don't ever you don't ever have to walk alone
            B7
You see, so c mon take my hand
                         E
baby won't you walk with me?

            E
When you're waiting for a voice to come
       A                 E
In the night there is no one
                 B7
Doncha feel like crying?
                 E
Doncha feel like crying?
                   B7             E
Don't ya feel like cry-cry-crying. . . . .
(Cry to me, cry to me)
                   B7            E
Don't ya feel like cry-cry-crying . . . . . .
(Cry to me)
