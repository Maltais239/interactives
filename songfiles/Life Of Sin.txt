E                                      B7
Lately things have been a little complicated
B7                         E
Quality of life has got me down
E                                          B7
Well, the sex is cheap and the talk is overrated
B7                                       E
And the boys and me still working on the sound


Verse 2

E                                            B7
A little happiness, a little love was all I wanted
B7                                           E
Sure as Hell thought I'd found it but I was wrong
E                                        A
She left my heart feeling taunted and my memories all haunted
         E             B7               E
But it's her I have to thank for all my songs


Chorus

E                A
So every day I'm smoking my brain hazy
E
All I can do to keep from going crazy
E                                    B7
But the paranoia is slowly creeping in
B7     A
I keep drinking myself silly
A    E
Only way for this hillbilly
E                   B7                E
And I thank God for this here life of sin

Bridge

B7
Every morning when I rise I look in the mirror and despise
E                                         A
the sight of everything and all that I've become
B7
The level of my medicating some might find intimidating
B7
But that's alright 'cause it don't bother me none
