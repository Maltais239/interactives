I Don't Know
The Sheepdogs
Key: E

Lyrics:
E D A
Never have I heard a more disturbing word
Holding out so long, I never felt so quite disturbed

I get up in the morning
I dont know
Waiting for the evening
I dont know
been looking for what's coming
I dont know
Will someone please
tell me

Looking back at me is more a mystery
Pages and pages of ancient history

I get up in the morning
I dont know
Waiting for the evening
I dont know
Looking for the evening
I dont know
Will someone please
tell me
right into next part
B D A x4

I dont know
Tell me
I dont know (I dont know)
Tell me

E D A 12 TIMES THROUGH
E 4 beats
G 4 beats
A tika tika ta x 2
B tika tika ta
walkup C C# D Eb E

I don't know
Tell me
I don' know (I don't know)
Tell me

I dont know
Tell me
I dont know (I dont know)
Tell me (rit)
