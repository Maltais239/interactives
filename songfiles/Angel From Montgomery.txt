G           C     G              C
I am an old woman named after my mother
   G          C       D7                 G
my old man is another child that's grown old
G              C       G                   C
if dreams were thunder and lightning was desire
     G                    C           D7         G
this old house would have burnt down a long time ago


G          F          C          G
make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
G         F            C       G
make me a poster of an old rodeo
G                F              C          G
just give me the one thing that I can hold on to
G                  C                 D7          G
to believe in this living, is just a hard way to go


G            C          G          C
when I was a young girl I had me a cowboy
   G               C              D7            G
he weren't much to look at just a free rambling man
G               C             G             C
but there was a long time and no matter how I try
G              C              D7          G
the years just flow by like a broken down dam

refrain

G                    C       G                   C
there's flies in the kitchen I can hear them all buzzing
G                C               D7        G
and I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
G                  C      G                 C
how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
G                C                D7         G
come home in the evening and have nothing to say?
