Do you remember when the water flowed up to the banks of the creek out back?
Some things that once were whole are broken now, and may again be made intact

We were like continents colliding, mountains raised up to the sky
Slowly eroded down now they no longer stand so high

Do you remember

Had a beat up car despite that. Once or twice I slept in the back
Watched the stars that shone in the sky

And When we look up now though time has passed
We know They still shine just as bright

Do you remember

in at the end of the bass run 1:50
And It seemed to us the Sun in our sky would never set
Though it's descending now, we're not no we're not...in total darkness yet
