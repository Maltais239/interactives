Verse 1
(Cocker's version is a lot slower than the Beatles
and isn't exactly the same.)

A              E       Bm
What would you do if I sang out of tune,
          E            E7          A
would you stand up and walk out on me?
             E             Bm
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
         E          E7          A
and I'll try not to sing out of key.


Chorus

A                 G                D            A
Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends.
                    G                  D            A
I just keep trying, high with a little help from my friends.
                  G                  D            A
I wanna get high, high with a little help from my friends.

Verse 2

A         E          Bm
What do I do when my love is away?
        E            E7  A
Does it worry you to be alone? Oh no!
         E           Bm
How do I feel by the end of the day ?
        E                  E7      A
Are you sad because you're on your own? (I don't get sad!)

Would you believe in a love at first sight?

I'm certain that it happens all the time.
     E                   Bm
What do you see when you turn out the light?
        E                   E7        A
I don't see too much, but I know it's mine.
