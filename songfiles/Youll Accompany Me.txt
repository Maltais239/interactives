 A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
A           E               E6      E
 the sky is starlit and the time is right
A                 E              E6      E
 and still you're telling me you have to go
A           E                       E6         E
 before you leave there's something you should know

A              E              E6       E
 I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
A               E                E6       E
 I've seen your long hair flying when you run
A             E                 E6       E
 I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
A         E              E6      E
 someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me

Chorus
A                        D       A
 someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me
A                              A        E
 out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
A                                  D        A
 you're high above me, now, you're wild and free, ah, but

Verse 2
A            E                 E6     E
 some people say that love's a losing game
A               E             E6       E
 you start with fire, but you lose the flame
A          E                E6            E
 the ashes smolder, but the warmth's soon gone
A           E               E6      E
 you end up cold and lonely on your own
A             E                   E6      E
 I'll take my chances, babe, I'll risk it all
A              E             E6       E
 I'll win your love, or I'll take the fall
A             E                   E6       E
 I've made my mind up, girl, it's meant to be
A         E              E6      E
 someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me

 someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me
A                                  A      E
 it's written down somewhere, it's got to be
A                             D        A
 you're high above me, flying wild and free, ah, but
A         E             E6       E
 someday, lady, you'll accomp'ny me
