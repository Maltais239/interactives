Verse
        D                 G         D
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
 D     F#       G
Everywhere you go;
        Em                  A7      D            Bm
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
       A               E           A7
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

Verse
       D                  G          D
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
 D        F#     G
Toys in every store,
          Em               A7          D             B7
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
        Em/B A     D
On your own  front door.

Bridge
           F#
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
        Bm       F#        Bm
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
 E
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
        A       E7         A7
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
     A
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
 D     F#      G
Everywhere you go;
           Em                A7     D                  Bm
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
         A                 E                A7
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
 D        F#         G
Soon the bells will start,
         Em                        A7          D              B7
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
          Em/B A     D
Right within   your heart.

Toys in every store,

But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be

On your own  front door.

Sure it's Christmas once more.
