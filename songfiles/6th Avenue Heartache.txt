G        D                  A               Em                G
Sirens ring, the shots ring out, A stranger cries screams out loud
         D                         A               Em                       G
I had my world strapped against my back, I held my hands, never knew how to act


        D                                         A
And the same black line that was drawn on you was drawn on me
                        Em            G
And now it's draw'n' me in 6th Avenue heartache


      D                 A            Em            G
Below me was a homeless man, Singin' songs I knew complete
             D                    A               Em                     G
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand, It's fifty years, stood where he stands

            D             A                  Em            G
Now walkin' home on those streets, The river winds move my feet
        D                         A                      Em           G
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams, They stood by me, just like moonbeams

REF

             D                       A                      Em                      G
Look out the window, down upon that street, And gone like a midnight where was that man
              D                            A                 Em                       G
But I see his six string laid against that wall, And all his things, they all look so small
                 D                     A               Em            G
I got my fingers crossed on a shooting star, Just like me just moved on


E                                         B
And the same black line that was drawn on you was drawn on me
F#m           A
And now it's draw'n' me in 6th Avenue heartache
