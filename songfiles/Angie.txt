Angie, Angie, when will those dark clouds disappear
       E7    G              F4   F       C4  C
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here
        G                          dm           am  C
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
          F               G
You can't say we're satisfied
    am     E7    G           F4  F        C4  CC/Ham
But Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful yeah, but ain't it time we said goodbye
Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here
Solo: am  E7  G  F4  F  C4  C  C/H  am  E7  G  F4  F  C4  C
Oh Angie don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angiem ain't it time we said goodbye
