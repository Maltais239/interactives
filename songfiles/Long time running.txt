Long time running
Tragically Hip
Key: A



A                               F#m
Does your mother tell you things
                    A
Long, long when I'm gone
                  F#m
Who you talking to
                           E
Is she telling you I'm the one
       D
It's a grave mistake
        A  E/G#  F#mEDE
And I'm wide awake
A                    F#m
Drive-in's rained out
                           A
Weatherman wet fingers the sky
He pokes it out
   F#m
He pulls it in
              E
He don't know why
         D           E
It's the same mistake
                            A  E/G#  F#m  E    D      E
Chorus          It's been a long          time running
            A  E/G#  F#m  E    D     E
It's been a long          time coming
          A
It's well worth the wait
F#m A  F#m A                   F#m
           We don't go anywhere
Just on trips
A                      F#m
We haven't seen a thing
                          E
We still don't know where it is
       D           E
It's a safe mistake
            A  E/G#  F#m  E    D      E
It's been a long          time running
            A  E/G#  F#m  E    D     E
It's been a long          time coming
D                              A
Well, well it's all the same mistake
                   D
Dead to rights and wide awake
                A
I'll drop a caribou
                D
I'll tell on you
                F#mEDE
I'll tell on you
A                           F#m
You got a boat load of nerve
                            A
But I would say you've been told
                          F#m
You work me against my friends
                               E
And you'll get left out in the cold
         D           E
It's the same mistake
Chorus
