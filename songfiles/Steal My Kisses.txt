I pulled into Nashville, Tennessee
D                                  G
but you wouldn't even come to see me
G                                    C    c#
you said you were heading up to carolina
D                                   G
you know I'm gonna be right there behind you

G                                            C        C#
cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
D                                    G
always have to steal my kisses from you
G                                    C             C#
always have to steal my kisses from you
D                                    G
always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I love to hear that warm southern rain
Just to hear it fall it the sweetest sounding thing
and to see it fall on your simple country dress
it's like heaven to me I must confess

cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
always have to steal my kisses from you
always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I've been hanging round you for days
but when I lean in you just turn your head away
ohh no you didn't mean that
she said ' I love the way you think, but I hate the way you act

Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
always have to steal my kisses from you
always to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you
first time breakdown a capella
twice then instrumental break (bass solo)
