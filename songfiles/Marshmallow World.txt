#1.
 E      A           E            A
It's a marshmallow world in the winter,
E7       A                       E7
When the snow comes to cover the ground,
         Bm       E7           A             F#m
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,
  Bm           B7       E7
I wait for it all year round.

#2.
E         A           E            A
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
E7     A                     E7
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
        Bm      E7         A       F#m
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
     Bm               B7   E     A
It's shining so your nose won't freeze.

CHORUS:
    A7                      D          Bm
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
Em            A7        D
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
    B7                     E          C#m7
The world is your snowball just for a song,
    B7               E   E7
Get out and roll it along.

#3.
E      A         E              A    A7
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
E7     A              A7        E7
Take a walk with your favourite girl,
       Bm    E7            A         F#m
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,
   Bm       B7     E     E7    A
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.

CHORUS:
    A7                      D          Bm
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
Em            A7        D
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
    B7                     E          C#m7
The world is your snowball just for a song,
    B7               E   E7
Get out and roll it along.
