Just Breathe
Pearl Jam
Key: C

Intro: | C | G | x2 (Two bars on each chord; this goes for much of the song but you can
figure it out throughout..)

C                                         G
Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
C                                         G
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
C                                         G
Oh I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love
C                                         G
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they've got none, uh-huh

Am
Stay with me...
F
Let's just breathe...

C                                          G
Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
C                                          G
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
C                                          G
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me believe
Am
Stay with me
       F
You're all I see...

G              Dm
Did I say that I need you?
G              Dm
Did I say that I want you?
F                     Am
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
F                 G
No one knows this more than me
G7
As I come clean...shut up now

C                                           G
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
C                                           G
Everything you gave and nothing you would save, oh no
Am                          F
Nothing you would take everything you gave...

G               Dm
Did I say that I need you?
G               Dm
Oh, did I say that I want you?
F               Am
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
F                 G
No one knows this more than me
G7
And I come clean, ah...
C G
Am                     F
Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Am
Hold me 'till I die
F
Meet you on the other side...
