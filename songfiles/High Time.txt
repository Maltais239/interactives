Key: D



    D           C#m  G#           F#
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
A                   E  D              A
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go.

      B        E         BA
I was having a high time,
           E         D  A         E       G       A
living the good life, I,   well I know.

    D          C#m          G#     F#
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay.
A               E     D                    A
Now listen here baby, 'cause I mean what I say.

    B        E         BA
I'm having a high time,
           E         D  A         E
living the good life, I,   well I know.

F                        E
I was losing time, I had nothing to do,
B                  C#m  F#mE
No one to fight, I came to you.
F                      E
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw,
    B                   C#m     F#mE   Esus4           D      A
The line is busted, the last one I saw.

D             C#m      G#            F#
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain,
A                         E     D                        A
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying.

        B          E         BA
I could show you a high time,
           E         D    A           E           G       A
living the good life, Ahh,   don't be that way.

D             C#m               G#        F#
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong,
A                 E        D                   A
Come in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone.

         B         E         BA
We could have us a high time,
           E         D    A           E           G       A
living the good life, Ahh,   don't be that way.
