D    G
Well baby used to stay out all night long
She made my cry She done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open that`s no lie
tables turning, now her turns to cry
          D7                C                G
Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now
Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spent all my money playing a high class game
She put me out it was a pity how i cried
the tables turnin now, her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now
Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now

Well, I used to wake the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I gotten worried she could ease my aching head
but now she`s here and there
with ev`ry man in town
instead of trying to make me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now
Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now

Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now
Because I used to love her, but it`s all over now
