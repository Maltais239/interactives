Chorus 1    G          C      G
          My daddy was a bankrobber,
                     Am  G
But he never hurt no-body.
                 C         D
He just loved to live that way,
       C        D          G
And he loved to steal your  money.


Verse 1 G                C       G
         Some is rich, and some is poor,
                   Am    G
That's the way the world is.
                       C     D
But i don't believe in lying back,
C          D        G
Sayin' how bad your  luck is.
G             C       G
So we came to jazz it up,
                 Am   G
We never loved a shovel.
                   C         D
Break your back to earn your pay,
    C         D      G
An' don't for-get to  grovel.


Chorus 2 G          C      G
          Daddy was a bankrobber
                     Am  G
But he never hurt no-body
                 C         D
He just loved to live that way
       C        D         G
And he loved to take your money

Verse 2     G            C       G
         The old man spoke up in a bar
                     Am    G
Said i never been in prison
                   C      D
A lifetime serving one ma-chine
   C         D          G
Is ten times worse than  prison
G                  C       G
Imagine if all the boys in jail
                     Am  G
Could now get out to-gether
                                C      D
Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?
C            D    G
While he was being clever
G                        C       G
Someday you'll meet your rocking chair
                        Am   G
'Cos that's where we're spinning
                           C         D
There's no poiunt to wanna comb your hair
C         D        G
When it's grey and thinning

And i know that they never  will.
