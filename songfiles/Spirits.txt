Verse

C         G                      F
I've been looking at the stars tonight
             C        G               F
And I think oh how I miss that bright sun
C         G                      F
I'll be a dreamer till the day I die
             C          G        F
But they say oh how the good die young
              Am
But we're all strange
                           G
and maybe we don't want to change

      F                        C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                          G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
      F                        C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                          Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
        F                      C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
      F                        C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                          G
Spirits in my head and they won't go


Verse

C         G                    F
I spend a lot of nights on the run
            C      G                F
and I think oh I'm lost and cant be found
C        G                     F
I'm just waiting for my day to come
            C          G               F
And I think oh I don't want to let you down
                            Am
'Cause something inside has changed
                                    G
And maybe we don't want to stay the same

Am                          G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
      F                        C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                          Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
        F                      C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
        F                      C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh


Bridge

    F              C
And I don't want a never ending life
       G                          Am
I just want to be alive while I'm here
    F              C
And I don't want a never ending life
       G                          Am
I just want to be alive while I'm here
    F               C
And I don't want to see another night
       G                            Am
Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here

Spirits in my head and they won't go

I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                          Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
