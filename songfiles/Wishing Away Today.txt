C       G/B  C
Wishing away today
F                 C/E                 G/B
Counting down the hours until this is yesterday
Am                G/B        C
Rewriting all the things I'd say
     F                 C/E             G/B
If I had those moments back I would perfect our little play
                C      GC
But for now I'm wishing
F       G    C
Wishing away today

All the people I would meet
If I didn't always walk around looking at my feet
The things I could have seen
But I was rushing to the show and I never got a seat
Wishing away today

The shore's not so far away
The days sure slipped by while I looked the other way
Less ahead than behind I'd say
Each one built up so high with all our expectations
Wishing away today

Sun is slipping down
It's easier to walk with both feet on the ground
And I'm listening to the sound
Of nothing but the silence of the world still spinning round
And hoping
That I won't always be wishing
Wishing away today
Wishing away today
Wishing away today
