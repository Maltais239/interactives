Santa Monica
by Everclear
Key: G

Attempt at rhythm -

if you can't pick it up from the song, here's a valiant attempt..

Verse -

G5   G5   x x x x    G5   G5   G5/E   G5   G5   x x x x

(repeat.. the x's represent muting the strings and stumming)

Same basic strumming technique throughout the rest of the song.


Verse I

                         G5     G5/E   G5
I am still living with your ghost
       G5/E         G5      G5/E  G5
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
           G5/E               D5   E5    C5
I don't want to be your downtime
       C5    D5     G5
I don't want to be your stupid game


Verse II

                         G5     G5/E   G5
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
       G5/E         G5      G5/E  G5
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
           G5/E               D5   E5    C5
I don't want to be the bad guy
       C5    D5     G5
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

           I just want to see some palm trees
           Go and try to shake away this disease

Chorus
                     C5
We can live beside the ocean
C5            D5          G5
Leave the fire behind
G5               E5     D5
Swim out past the breakers
D5          C5      G5
Watch the world die


Verse III

                         G5     G5/E   G5
I am still dreaming of your face
       G5/E         G5      G5/E  G5
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
           G5/E               D5   E5    C5
I don't want to be your good time
       C5    D5     G5
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore


Verse IV

                         G5     G5/E   G5
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
       G5/E         G5      G5/E  G5
Insane and rising in my own weird way
           G5/E               D5   E5    C5
I don't want to be the bad guy
       C5    D5     G5
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

           I just want to feel some sunshine
           I just want to find some place to be alone


Chorus
                     C5
We can live beside the ocean
C5            D5          G5
Leave the fire behind
G5               E5     D5
Swim out past the breakers
D5          C5      G5
Watch the world die
