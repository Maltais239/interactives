Intro: A

Well it was nearly summer, sat on your roof
         D        A              G
Yeah we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon
       D      A            G           D
And I showed you stars you never could see
                       D                  C
Babe, it couldnÕt have been that easy to forget about me

      D        A              G         A
Baby time meant nothinÕ anything seemed real
                D        A             G
Yeah you could kiss like fire and you made me feel
            D   A           G         D
Like every word you said was meant to be
                       D          A       C
Babe, it couldnÕt have been that easy to forget about me


                 D  AG
Baby even the losers
     D          A  G
Get lucky sometimes
           D   AG
Even the losers
         G
Keep a little bit of pride
          A
They get lucky sometimes

Two cars parked on the overpass
A              Asus4
Rocks hit the water like broken glass
A           Asus4
Should have known right then it was too good to last
A     Asus4               G               G
ItÕs such a drag when you live in the past
