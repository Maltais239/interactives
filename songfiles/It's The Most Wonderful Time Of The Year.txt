It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
Andy Williams
Key: D
1963 (Edward Pola and George Wyle)

         D    Bm        Em  A       D    (Bm D Em A)
It's the most wonderful time of the year
         Em          A
With the kids jingle belling
    D                     G
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"
         D    Bm        Em  A       D    (Bm D Em A)
It's the most wonderful time of the year

         D   Bm       Em    A   D  (Bm D Em A)
It's the hap-happiest season of all
           Em      A             D
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
     G
When friends come to call
         D    Bm       Em    A   D  D7
It's the hap- happiest season of all

            G
There'll be parties for hosting
     D           Bm
Marshmallows for toasting
    Em       A          D
And caroling out in the snow
            Gm
There'll be scary ghost stories
    F
And tales of the glories of
Gm                      A A7
Christmases long, long ago

         D    Bm        Em  A       D    (Bm D Em A)
It's the most wonderful time of the year
            Em          A
There'll be much mistle-toeing
    D
And hearts will be glowing
     G
When love ones are near
         D    Bm        Em  A       D
It's the most wonderful time of the year

            G
There'll be parties for hosting
     D           Bm
Marshmallows for toasting
    Em       A          D
And caroling out in the snow
            Gm
There'll be scary ghost stories
    F
And tales of the glories of
Gm                      A
Christmases long, long ago

         D    Bm        Em  A       D    (Bm D Em A)
It's the most wonderful time of the year
            Em          A
There'll be much mistle-toeing
    D
And hearts will be glowing
     G
When love ones are near
         D    Bm        Em
It's the most wonderful time
              D    Bm        Em
yes, It's the most wonderful time
         D    Bm        Em
It's the most wonderful time
       D    Bm        Em  A       D
oh the most wonderful time of the year
