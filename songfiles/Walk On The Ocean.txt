Toad The Wet Sprocket - Walk On The Ocean
Key: G
(Capo 4th fret - all chords relative)

Verse 1
               G C G            A           Em C G
We spotted the ocean     at the head of the trail
    A            G C G            D/F#      A Asus4 A
But where are we going,     we're so far away
         G C G            A           Em D/F# G
Somebody told me     that this is the place
      A            G/B C G        D/F#         A Asus4 A
where everything's better     and everything's safe

Chorus
            Em   G               D/F#    A
Walk on the Ocean    Step on the stone
              Em   G                D/F#   A
Flesh becomes water    Wood becomes bone

Verse 2
               G C G       A             Em C G
A half an hour later    We packed up our things
   A              Em C G         D/F#         A Asus4 A
We said we'd send letters    And all of those little things
                      G C G             A               Em D/F# G
And they knew we were lying    But they smiled just the same
    A           G/B C G        D/F#      A Asus4 A
It seemed they'd already    Forgotten we came

Chorus x2
            Em   G              D/F#    A
Walk on the Ocean    Step on the stone
              Em   G              D/F#   A
Flesh becomes water    Wood becomes bone

Bridge

Verse 3
                G C G                  A             Em D/F# G
Now back at the homestead    Where the air makes you choke
      A            G/B C G         D/F#       A Asus4 A
Where people don't know you    And trust is a joke
                G C G            A           Em D/F# G
Don't even have pictures    Just memories to hold
         A            G/B C G         D/F#        A
It grows sweeter each season    As we slowly grow old

Chorus x2
            Em   G              D/F#    A
Walk on the Ocean    Step on the stone
              Em   G              D/F#   A
Flesh becomes water    Wood becomes bone
