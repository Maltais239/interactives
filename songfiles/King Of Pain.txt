notes- the timing is a little weird for the intro where it goes
but not that hard. in the second part of the intro, the chords are the way they are so
                                                                                   G
can walk up with the bass line if you listen for it. also, i usually play the open
        AmG                  G        FG
for the   part, and a barre  for the   part.
depending on how you're playing this, you might want to keep the chord switches during
verses, on the album it sounds like a muted arpeggio, so i just finger-pick it.
