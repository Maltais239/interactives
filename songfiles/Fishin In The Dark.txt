Fishin In The Dark
Key: D

G harmonica

Verse 1
D
Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight, shinin' through the trees
G
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs are floatin' on the breeze,
         D
Baby get ready
D
Across the field where the creek turns back by the old stump road
G
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
           D     A
Baby get ready, oooh oohooh


Chorus
D
You and me going fishin' in the dark
D
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
          G
Where the cool grass grows

D
Down by the river in the full moonlight
D
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
     G
Just movin' slow
   Em                      A
Stayin' the whole night through
Em               A       D
Feels so good to be with you

Verse 2
D
Spring is almost over and the summer's comin', the days are gettin' long
G
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along
         D
Baby get ready
D
And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite

We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
          D     A
Baby get ready, ooh oohooh

Feels so good to be with you
