We Should Know
Darren Maltais

When our minds
Are all a clutter
And our hearts flit and flutter
When we're pulled
One way or another
We should know
That we know better

(chorus)
And we fight ourselves like the strongest foe
And listen to the winds and wails with woe
Though somewhere beneath we know we shouldn't

When we listen to a black
Angel on our shoulder
And with dark thoughts
It grows bolder
And its grip chills us colder
While our hopes in ashes smolder

(chorus)
As we writhe and roll like a ship in a storm
And any port at all is looking safe and warm
It's hard to hear the voice that warns us to keep sailing

What can still us
When our heart is racing
And stop the ticking clock when our mind is pacing
Wrestle all the demons
That were facing
Take away the poison
That we're tasting

(chorus)
We should know we know better than to listen to the dark
We should know we know better than to douse the spark
We should know we know better than to let ourselves be taken
