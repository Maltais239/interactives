N.C.                                          Am D G
Come on Harry, we wanna say "Goodnight" to you


Verse 1
C
Holdin' me back
          Am
Gravity's holdin' me back
              D
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
             G
Why don't we leave it at that?
C
Nothin' to say
               Am
And everything gets in the way
             D
Seems you cannot be replaced
            G
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh


Chorus
C              Am             D
  In this world, it's just us
    G                            C
You know it's not the same as it was
             Am             D
In this world, it's just us
    G                            C
You know it's not the same as it was
      Am         D
As it was, as it was
    G
You know it's not the same


Verse 2
C
Answer the phone,
               Am
"Harry, you're no good alone
            D
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
           G
What kinda pills are you on?"
C
Ringin' the bell
             Am
And nobody's coming to help
           D
Your daddy lives by himself
                 G
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh


Chorus
C              Am             D
  In this world, it's just us
    G                            C
You know it's not the same as it was
             Am             D
In this world, it's just us
    G                            C
You know it's not the same as it was
      Am         D
As it was, as it was
    G
You know it's not the same

(Hey!)
      G
As it was
    C                            Am
You know it's not the same as it was
      D          G
As it was, as it was
