You May Be Right
Billy Joel
Key: A








A
Friday night I crashed your party
A
Saturday I said I'm sorry
A                               E
Sunday came and trashed me out again
      Bm
I was only having fun
       G
Wasn't hurting anyone
E                             A (intro)
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change


A
I've been stranded in the combat zone
A
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
A                              E
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
        Bm
And you told me not to drive
      G
But I made it home alive
       E                                A
So you said that only proves that I'm insane


           E
You may be right
          A
I may be crazy
       E             D              F#m           A
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
             E
Turn out the light
              A
Don't try to save me
           D               E
You may be wrong for all I know
               A
But you may be right


A
Remember how I found you you there
 A
Alone in your electric chair
  A                              E
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
         Bm
You were lonely for a man
       G
I said take me as I am
           E                              A
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while


A
Now think of all the years you tried to
A
Find someone to satisfy you
A                          E
I might be as crazy as you say
       Bm
If I'm crazy then it's true
          G
That it's all because of you
        E                          A
And you wouldn't want me any other way


           E
You may be right
         A
I may be crazy
       E             D              F#m           A
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
                 E
It's too late to fight
                   A
It's too late to change me
           D               E
You may be wrong for all I know
               A
But you may be right


           E
You may be right
         A
I may be crazy
       E             D              F#m           A
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
             E
Turn out the light
             A
Don't try to save me
           D               E
You may be wrong for all I know
               A
But you may be right


A
You may be wrong but you may be right
A
You may be wrong but you may be right
