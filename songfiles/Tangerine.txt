Measur   ing a summer's day,
  Am   Asus4 Am G      D   C  C    Am G D
I only find  it slips away to grey,
    Am          G        D
The hours, they bring me pain.

Tangerine, Tangerine,
G        D                C     D
Living reflections from a dream;
G         D                C    D
I was her love, she was my queen,
                   G       C  D
And now a thousand years between.

Thinking   how it used to be,
Am   Asus4 Am      G      D     C    C    Am G D
Does she   still remember times like these?
   Am       G   D
To think of us again?
