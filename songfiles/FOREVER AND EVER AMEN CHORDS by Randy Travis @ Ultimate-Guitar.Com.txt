Verse 1

    D              G           D
You may think that I'm talking foolish
       G                           D
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
    G                    D
You may wonder how I can promise you now
     E                        A
This love that I feel for you always will be
    D               G             D
But you're not just time that I'm killing
    G                      D
I'm no longer one of those guys
   G                   D
As sure as I live this love that I give
   E                        A
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh baby


Chorus

D         G           D        G              D
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever amen
   G                       D
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
   E                         A
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
       D          G            D
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
        G                  E
I'll be happy to tell you again
G         A           D        G        E        A      D
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, amen

Verse 2

         D              G         D
They say time takes its toll on a body
          G                            D
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
    G                               D
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
          E                      A
And if it all fell out well, I'd love you anyway
         D             G           D
They say time can play tricks on a memory
     G                         D
Make people forget things they knew
           G                D
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
       E                     A
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh darlin'


Chorus

D         G           D        G              D
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever amen
   G                       D
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
   E                         A
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
       D          G            D
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
     G                       E
Just listen to how this song ends


Outro

G         A           D        G        E        A      D
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, amen
G         A           D        G        E        A
I'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever
   Bm       G        E        A        N.C.  D
Forever and ever, forever and ever ... A - men
