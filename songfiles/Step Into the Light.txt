Step Into the Light

Key: G

 We fell asleep in a pool of you hair
                                     C
When I awoke you weren't there I was  alone
       G
In the  dark
G
All the thoughts that orbit around
                                    C
You're the sun blocking them out so bright
so bright
              D
You said come on
     C        G
Step into the light

              D
You said come on
     C        G
Step into the light

G
All the minutes they turn into hours
All your secrets now they're ours
        C
That we share
                    G
Every minute you're there

G
Forget the place, forget the time
i got to thinkin' at least this is mine
        C
for the night
G
For the night
     D                   G
When we stepped into the light
        DmC                 G
When we   stepped into the  Light

All the good things we wish they would last
and these times we hate that they pass
from out sight
from our sight
Don't be afraid
to step into the light
