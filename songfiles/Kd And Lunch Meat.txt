Verse
          Bb
Toss and turn
              Eb
I'm late for work again
                 Bb
But I'm feeling good
                         Eb
Yeah ‘cause I just got stoned I think I'm quittin' my job today
                 Cm                         Gm
I'm gonna get my tips and then I'm gonna walk away
                 Bb
Gonna get a new job or maybe take some time off

             Bb
To learn and burn
                    Eb
I got something to roll around (something to roll around)
                 Bb
And I'm feeling good
                        Eb
Don't we all need some time to unwind, take the edge off
                  Cm                          Gm
Yeah I want you here, why don't you call in sick

Maybe you could just quit, baby that's what I did

Tuesday mornin'
                 Eb
You're out the door and I'm just tagging along
                   Bb
The sun’s coming up
                      Eb
Yeah the traffic is stuck and you're acting nonchalant
                        Cm
But babe I know you're stressed
                Gm                     Bb
And yes I am too, but lately I been thinking
                 Bb
That maybe if we wanted to

                      Bb
Yeah, we could take a trip
                       Eb
We could rock down in Texas (yeehaw)
                       Bb
Or we could trip on your couch
                           Eb
Put something fun in our mouths and watch the day melt
                              Cm
Whatever we felt like at the time
                               Gm
Whatever frame of mind you're in the point is
                   Bb
We would have the time
    Bb
The point is we would have the time
    Bb
And don't it make you wanna
