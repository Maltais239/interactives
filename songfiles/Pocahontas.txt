Aurora Borealis

    D
The icy sky at night

Em
Paddles cut the water

     D
In a long and hurried flight

         A         C       G         D
From the white man  to the fields of green

        A        C      G     D
and the homeland  we've never seen

D   Em D
       

They killed us in our teepees
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks and the wagons come
And the night falls on the settin' sun

D D Em D A C G D
               
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box at the top of the stairs
With my indian rug and a pipe to share

D D Em D  A C G D   A C G D
                          
(verse:)


I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
and find out how she felt
In the mornin' on the fields of green
In the homeland we've never seen

D

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astradome and the first teepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
