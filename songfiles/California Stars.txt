Intro:

G D C G
      
           G
Id like to rest my heavy head tonight
     D
On a bed of California stars
           C
Id like to lay my weary bones tonight
     G
On a bed of California stars
           G
Id love to feel your hand touching mine
            D
And tell me why I must keep working on
        C
Yes, Id give my life to lay tonight
     G
On a bed of California stars

G D C G
      

           G
Id like to dream my troubles all away
     D
On a bed of California stars
C
Jump up from my star bed and make another day
     G
Underneath my california stars
               G
They hang like grapes on vines that shine
               C
And warm the lovers glass like friendly wine
        D
So Id give this world just to dream a dream with you
       G
On our bed of California stars

G D C G
