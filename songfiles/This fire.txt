This fire

Key: F

       F      C        F   C
Like a smoker craves a cigarette
  F          C         G
A good thing thats not happened yet
F        C    F     C
Youre as good as it gets
      G
And I know it

Am      G/B       C
Can you cool this fire?
Can you cool this fire?

A hunger that you cant contain
That cant be cooled by any rain
Youre the itch in the back of my brain
I cant get to

Can you cool this fire?
Can you cool this fire?

Pages that you cant stop turning
A flame that just wont stop burning
Your love is one that Im earning
Slowly

Can you cool this fire?
Can you cool this fire?

Do you intend to make me wait?
Why do you stop and hesitate?
Youve got the drink to satiate
This thirst

Can you cool this fire?
Can you cool this fire?
