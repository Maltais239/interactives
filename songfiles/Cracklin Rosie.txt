Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
                                             F
We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go

Taking it slow, Lord don't you know
Dm                       G7
   Have me a time with a poor man's lady

C
Hitchin' on a twilight train
                                          F
Ain't nothing there that I care to take along

Maybe a song, to sing when I want
      Dm                       G7              C
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune

Oh, I love my Rosie child
C          F       G       C
She got the way to make me happy
C       F      G     C
You and me, we go in style

Dm
Cracklin' Rosie you're a store-bought woman

You make me sing like a guitar hummin'

So hang on to me, girl
                       G
Our song keeps runnin' on

Play it now
Play it now
Play it now, my baby

C
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
                                         F
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right

We got all night to set the world right
Dm                           G7                C
  Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah
C     F       G     C
Oh, I love my Rosie child
C           F      G       C
She got the way to make me happy
C       F      G     C
You and me, we go in style

Dm
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman

You make me sing like a guitar hummin'

So hang on to me, girl
                       G
Our song keeps runnin' on

Play it now
Play it now my baby
