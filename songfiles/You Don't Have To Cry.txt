In the morning, when you rise
       G                               D
do you think of me and how you left me crying?
        C           C
are you thinking of telephones
    G                             D
and managers and where you got to be at noon
        F        C
you are living a reality
       G                          D
I left years ago, it quite nearly killed me
       F                 C
in the long run, it will make you cry
         G                         D
make you crazy and old before your time
        F                  C
and the difference between me and you
              G
I won't argue right from wrong but I have time to
D
cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry

        C           C

        F        C
you are living a reality

        F                  C
and the difference between me and you
              G
I won't argue right or wrong but I have time to
D
cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
I said, cry, my baby, you don't have to cry
