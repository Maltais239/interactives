Boomer's Story
Ry Cooder
Key: G
 
Come and gather all around me
Listen to my tale of woe
Got some good advice to give you
Lots of things you oughta know
Take a tip from one who's traveled
And never stopped a-ramblin' 'round
'Cause once you get the roamin' fever
You never want to settle down, boy
You never want to settle down

Met a little gal in Frisco
And I asked her to be my wife
Told her I was tired of roamin'
Goin' to settle down for life
Then I heard the whistle blowin'
And I knew it was the Red Ball Train
And I left that gal beside the railroad
And I never saw the gal again, boy
I never saw the gal again

Saw the gal again
I never saw the gal again
Left that gal beside the railroad
I never saw the gal again

Traveled all over the country
I've traveled everywhere
Been on every Branch Line railroad
Never paid a nickel fare
Been from Maine to Califor'ny
Canada to Mexico
And I never tried to save no money
Now I got no place to go, boy
Now I got no place to go

Listen to a Boomer's story
Pay attention to what I say
Hear another train a-comin'
Guess I'll be on my way
If you wanna do me a favor
When I lay me down and die
Just dig my grave beside the railroad
So I can hear the trains go by, boy
So I can hear the trains go by
Hear the trains go

I can hear the trains go by
Just dig my grave beside the railroad
So I can hear the trains go by
