Verse 1
   Em            C           G
I awoke only to find my lungs empty
      D/F#       Em
And through the night
            C          G
So it seems I'm not breathing
    D/F#     Em                C              G
And now my dreams are nothing like they were meant to be
         D/F#     Em                C        G
And I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking down

    D/F#   Em                   C         G
And I'm afraid to sleep because of what haunts me
D/F# Em         C          G
Such as living with the uncertainty
D/F#      Em                       C
That I'll never find the words to say
             G            D/F#
Which would completely explain
Em         C          G         D/F#  N C
Just how I'm breaking down


Chorus
Dadd4(9)          Em                C
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
            Dadd4(9)           Em
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead
                       C
But now it's like the night is taking sides
    Dadd4(9)              Em          C
With all the worries that occupy the back of my mind
        Dadd4(9)      Em             C
Could it be this misery will suffice?

Verse 2  Gordon Downie
(D/F#)  Em               C          G
I've become a simple souvenir of someone's kill
    D/F#     Em                  C            G          D/F#
And like the sea I'm constantly changing from calm to ill
Em                         C              G                 D/F#
Madness fills my heart and soul as if the great divide could swallow me whole
    Em       C         G    D/F#  N C
Oh, how I'm breaking down



Chorus
Dadd4(9)          Em                C
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
           Dadd4(9)           Em
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead
                       C
But now it's like the night is taking sides
     Dadd4(9)             Em         C
With all the worries that occupy the back of my mind
        Dadd4(9)      Em            C
Could it be this misery will suffice?
            Dadd4(9)
Ooohhh my life

Someone come and, someone come and save my life (save my life)

Someone come and, someone come and save my life (save my life)

Someone come and, someone come and save my life

Could it be this misery will suffice?
