Verse 1

Am         G            F        C
You were a phonograph, I was a kid
   Am         G               F      C
I sat with an ear close, just listening
      Am             G               F             C
I was there when the rain tapped her way down your face
           Am      G          F            C
You were a miracle I was just holdin your space

Verse 2

     Am         G                  F            C
Well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
    Am           G            F          C
The past, she is haunted, the future is laced
Am             G              F         C
Heartbreak, ya know, drives a big black car
     Am             G              F          C
Swear i was in the back seat, just minding my own

Chorus

    G                                           C
And through the glass, the corn crows come like rain
           G                Am
They wont stay, they wont stay for
             C
Too long now
               G           Am
This could be all that we know...
    Dsus2
Of love and all.


Verse 3

     Am         G       F        C
Well you were a dancer, I was a rag
     Am         G             F          C
The song in my head, well was all that I had
Am         G        F           C
Hope was a letter I never could send
Am         G          F           C
Love was a country we couldn't defend

    G                 F                  C          G
And through the carnival we watch them go round and round
G                F                C               G
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns  ohhhhhhh


Verse 4

     Am         G         F       C
Well you were a magazine, I was a plain Jane
     Am             G          F           C
Just walking the sidewalks all covered in rain
Am            G        F            C
love to just get into some of your stories
Am          G          F           C
Just me and all of my plain Jane glory
