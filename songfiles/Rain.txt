Rain
Beatles
Key: G



       G               C       D          G
If the Rain comes they run and hide their heads
     C        D       G
They might as well be dead
       C
If the Rain comes
       G
If the Rain comes

                         C    D        G
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
    C         D    G
And sip their lemonade
         C
When the sun shines
         G
When the sun shines
      C9
Raaaaaaaain
        G
I don't mind
      C9
Shiiiiiiiine
              G
The weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
Raaaaaaaain
I don't mind
Shiiiiiiiiiine
The weather's fine

Can you hear me that when it rains and shines?
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me?
Raaaaaaaain
I don't mind
Shiiiiiiine
The weather's fine
