  Oh, the Milky Way has gone a little sour

The leaves dried and the flower fell away

  I've      been sitting,   waitin' for a sign

A        A/G            A/F#       A          D       G
  (They) don't check my head, but they, they check my style
A      A/G   A/F#  A        D          G
  The modern world    is a cold, cold world

  (And) all I meet    are cold, cold girls
