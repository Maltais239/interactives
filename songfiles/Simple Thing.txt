Simple Thing
Darren Maltais

You say, I don’t know what else I can do
But it’s a simple thing
a simple thing that I can show you
You say, It’s hard and things can’t be the way
they used to be
But it don’t have to be
when we decide to go easy

But it’s a simple thing
you can do
it’s a simple thing
I can show you

The spring is the time that’s supposed to be
the season when you’re starting
Instead you break apart
what you heart had been building

But it’s a simple thing
you can do
it’s a simple thing
I can show you

And time races on like
a barreling locomotive train
and makes those thoughts we
struggled with all in vain

because It’s the simple things, simple things that we do
the simple things, simple things show you
it’s a simple thing
you can do
it’s a simple thing
I can show you
