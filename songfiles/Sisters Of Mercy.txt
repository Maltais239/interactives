E      A          D          A         E         A     D   A
Oh the Sisters of Mercy they are not departed or gone

And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song

    A             D         A              E           A     D   A
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control
     C#m            G#m         C#m            G#m          E   Esus4 E
It begins with your family, but soon it comes round to your soul
         D                 A         G           F#m            E
Well I've been where you're hanging I think I can see how you're pinned

When you're not feeling holy your loneliness says that you've sinned

Verse 3:
          A          D          A    E           A     D   A
They lay down beside me I made my confession to them
     C#m             G#m        C#m         G#m          E   Esus4 E
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
        D         A              G           F#m         E Esus4 E
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
          A             D             A           E          A     D
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

D  E
   


Verse 4:
       A               D          A            E        A     D   A
When I left they were sleeping I hope you run into them soon
     C#m         G#m            C#m          G#m          E   Esus4 E
Dont turn on the lights you can read their address by the moon
       D              A           G              F#m            E
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night

We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
           A           D           A             E            A
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
