Verse

             E
I drink to remember, I smoke to forget
                 A
Some things to be proud of, some stuff to regret
                     Bsus2
Been down some dark alleys, in my own head
              A
Some thing is changing, changing, changing.

             E
I go back to Clifton to see my old friends
                A
The best people I could ever have met
          Bsus2
Skin up a fat one, hide from the Feds
             A
Something is changing, changing, changing.


Chorus

     E
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
      A                                       E
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
     E
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
      A                                         E
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay


Verse

             E
Down in the kitchen drinking white lightning
              A
He's with my momma, yelling and fighting
             Bsus2
It's not the first time praying for silence
             A
Something is changing, changing, changing


Chorus

     E
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
       A                                      E
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
      E
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
       A                                      E
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay


Bridge

           C#m                             E
There's a story for every corner of this place
 A                                             E
Running so hard you got out but your knees got grazed
        A7             Bsus2                    E
I'm an old dog but I learned some new tricks yeah


Chorus

      E
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
       A                                      E
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
      E
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
 Bsus2
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
       A                                      E
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
