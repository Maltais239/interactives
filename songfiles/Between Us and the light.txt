Between usand the light
Shadows lurk
Keep us in the dark
Grounded on earth
Between Us and the light
Us and the light

Between Us and the sun
Theres an eclipse
The shadow falls
Right where we live
Between Us and the sun
Us and the light

ahhs and melody twice

Between Us and the sky
Rain clouds lie
And pour down their thoughts
As floodwaters rise
Between Us and the sky
Us and the light

ahhs and melody once
solo build up

Between Us and the sea
Mountains are raised
The icy peaks
Warn us away
Between Us and the sea
Us and the light

ahhs and melody 3 times
