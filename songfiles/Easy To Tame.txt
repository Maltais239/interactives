Easy To Tame
Kim Mitchell
Key: C
C – F – C

C                           Am G
What am I doing to make you so sad?
F                                    C
We used to dance 'til we fell to our knees
C                           Am G
What am I doing to make you so sad?
F                             C
We used to kiss like a summer breeze

G–F(minisolo)
    

(CHORUS)
C                                    F
Cause you used to have love in your kisses
C                               F
And you used to put my heart in flames
G                                F
You used to give me all my three wishes
Am             G       F
You said I was easy to tame
                       C
You said I was easy to tame

F
     Can't you take me out of the rain baby?
C
     Why do you treat me like I'm so bad?

What am I doing to make you so sad?
We always made love when it rained
What am I doing to make you so sad?
I guess being in love is like being insane

(minisolo)G–F
    

'Cause you used to have love in your kisses
And you used to put my heart in flames
You used to give me all my three wishes
You said I was easy to tame
You said I was easy to tame

Solo (like the chorus)

You said I was easy to tame
You said I was easy to tame

'Cause you used to have love in your kisses
And you used to put my heart in flames
You used to give me all my three wishes
You said I was easy to tame
You said I was easy to tame
